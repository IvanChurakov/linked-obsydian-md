# Explore the Microsoft Authentication Library

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) can be used to provide secure access to Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, third-party web APIs, or your own web API. MSAL supports many different application architectures and platforms including .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android, and iOS.

MSAL gives you many ways to get tokens, with a consistent API for many platforms. Using MSAL provides the following benefits:

- No need to directly use the OAuth libraries or code against the protocol in your application.
- Acquires tokens on behalf of a user or on behalf of an application (when applicable to the platform).
- Maintains a token cache and refreshes tokens for you when they're close to expire. You don't need to handle token expiration on your own.
- Helps you specify which audience you want your application to sign in.
- Helps you set up your application from configuration files.
- Helps you troubleshoot your app by exposing actionable exceptions, logging, and telemetry.

Using MSAL, a token can be acquired from many application types: web applications, web APIs, single-page apps (JavaScript), mobile and native applications, and daemons and server-side applications. MSAL currently supports the platforms and frameworks listed in the following table.

## Authentication flows

The following table shows some of the different authentication flows provided by Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). These flows can be used in various application scenarios.

|Flow|Description|
|---|---|
|Authorization code|Native and web apps securely obtain tokens in the name of the user|
|Client credentials|Service applications run without user interaction|
|On-behalf-of|The application calls a service/web API, which in turns calls Microsoft Graph|
|Implicit|Used in browser-based applications|
|Device code|Enables sign-in to a device by using another device that has a browser|
|Integrated Windows|Windows computers silently acquire an access token when they're domain joined|
|Interactive|Mobile and desktops applications call Microsoft Graph in the name of a user|
|Username/password|The application signs in a user by using their username and password|
### Public client, and confidential client applications

Security tokens can be acquired by multiple types of applications. These applications tend to be separated into the following two categories. Each is used with different libraries and objects.

- **Public client applications**: Are apps that run on devices or desktop computers or in a web browser. They're not trusted to safely keep application secrets, so they only access web APIs on behalf of the user. (They support only public client flows.) Public clients can't hold configuration-time secrets, so they don't have client secrets.
- **Confidential client applications**: Are apps that run on servers (web apps, web API apps, or even service/daemon apps). They're considered difficult to access, and for that reason capable of keeping an application secret. Confidential clients can hold configuration-time secrets. Each instance of the client has a distinct configuration (including client ID and client secret).

# Initialize client applications

With MSAL.NET 3.x, the recommended way to instantiate an application is by using the application builders: `PublicClientApplicationBuilder` and `ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder`. They offer a powerful mechanism to configure the application either from the code, or from a configuration file, or even by mixing both approaches.

Before initializing an application, you first need to register it so that your app can be integrated with the Microsoft identity platform. After registration, you may need the following information (which can be found in the Azure portal):

- The client ID (a string representing a GUID)
- The identity provider URL (named the instance) and the sign-in audience for your application. These two parameters are collectively known as the authority.
- The tenant ID if you're writing a line of business application solely for your organization (also named single-tenant application).
- The application secret (client secret string) or certificate (of type X509Certificate2) if it's a confidential client app.
- For web apps, and sometimes for public client apps (in particular when your app needs to use a broker), you have to also set the `redirectUri` where the identity provider connects back to your application with the security tokens.

## Initializing public and confidential client applications from code

The following code instantiates a public client application, signing-in users in the Microsoft Azure public cloud, with their work and school accounts, or their personal Microsoft accounts.

```C#
IPublicClientApplication app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId).Build();
```

In the same way, the following code instantiates a confidential application (a Web app located at `https://myapp.azurewebsites.net`) handling tokens from users in the Microsoft Azure public cloud, with their work and school accounts, or their personal Microsoft accounts. The application is identified with the identity provider by sharing a client secret:

```C#
string redirectUri = "https://myapp.azurewebsites.net";
IConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithRedirectUri(redirectUri )
    .Build();
```

## Builder modifiers

In the code snippets using application builders, `.With` methods can be applied as modifiers (for example, `.WithAuthority` and `.WithRedirectUri`).

- `.WithAuthority` modifier: The `.WithAuthority` modifier sets the application default authority to a Microsoft Entra authority, with the possibility of choosing the Azure Cloud, the audience, the tenant (tenant ID or domain name), or providing directly the authority URI.
    
    ```C#
    var clientApp = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(client_id)
        .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, tenant_id)
        .Build();
    ```
    
- `.WithRedirectUri` modifier: The `.WithRedirectUri` modifier overrides the default redirect URI.
    
    ```C#
    var clientApp = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(client_id)
        .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, tenant_id)
        .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost")
        .Build();
    ```

## Modifiers common to public and confidential client applications

The table below lists some of the modifiers you can set on a public, or confidential client.

|Modifier|Description|
|---|---|
|`.WithAuthority()`|Sets the application default authority to a Microsoft Entra authority, with the possibility of choosing the Azure Cloud, the audience, the tenant (tenant ID or domain name), or providing directly the authority URI.|
|`.WithTenantId(string tenantId)`|Overrides the tenant ID, or the tenant description.|
|`.WithClientId(string)`|Overrides the client ID.|
|`.WithRedirectUri(string redirectUri)`|Overrides the default redirect URI. This is useful for scenarios requiring a broker.|
|`.WithComponent(string)`|Sets the name of the library using MSAL.NET (for telemetry reasons).|
|`.WithDebugLoggingCallback()`|If called, the application calls `Debug.Write` simply enabling debugging traces.|
|`.WithLogging()`|If called, the application calls a callback with debugging traces.|
|`.WithTelemetry(TelemetryCallback telemetryCallback)`|Sets the delegate used to send telemetry.|
## Modifiers specific to confidential client applications

The modifiers you can set on a confidential client application builder are:

|Modifier|Description|
|---|---|
|`.WithCertificate(X509Certificate2 certificate)`|Sets the certificate identifying the application with Microsoft Entra ID.|
|`.WithClientSecret(string clientSecret)`|Sets the client secret (app password) identifying the application with Microsoft Entra ID.|
# Exercise - Implement interactive authentication by using MSAL.NET

In this exercise you learn how to perform the following actions:

- Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform
- Use the `PublicClientApplicationBuilder` class in MSAL.NET
- Acquire a token interactively in a console application

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure account** with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free)
- **Visual Studio Code**: You can install Visual Studio Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- A version of the .NET SDK [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) (6.0, 7.0, or 8.0)

## Register a new application

1. Sign in to the portal: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
3. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.
4. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter your application's registration information:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Name**|`az204appreg`|
|**Supported account types**|Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**|
|**Redirect URI (optional)**|Select **Public client/native (mobile & desktop)** and enter `http://localhost` in the box to the right.|
5. Select **Register**.

Microsoft Entra ID assigns a unique application (client) ID to your app, and you're taken to your application's **Overview** page.

## Set up the console application

1. Launch Visual Studio Code and open a terminal by selecting **Terminal** and then **New Terminal**.
2. Create a folder for the project and change in to the folder.
    
    ```Bash
    md az204-auth
    cd az204-auth
    ```
    
3. Create the .NET console app.
    
    ```Bash
    dotnet new console
    ```
    
4. Open the _az204-auth_ folder in Visual Studio Code.
    
    ```Bash
    code . -r
    ```

## Build the console app

In this section, you add the necessary packages and code to the project.

### Add packages and using statements

1. Add the `Microsoft.Identity.Client` package to the project in a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
    
    ```Bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Client
    ```
    
2. Open the _Program.cs_ file and add `using` statements to include `Microsoft.Identity.Client` and to enable async operations.
    
    ```C#
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
    ```
    
3. Change the Main method to enable async.
    
    ```C#
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    ```

### Add code for the interactive authentication

1. You need two variables to hold the Application (client) and Directory (tenant) IDs. You can copy those values from the portal. Add the following code and replace the string values with the appropriate values from the portal.
    
    ```C#
    private const string _clientId = "APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID";
    private const string _tenantId = "DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID";
    ```
    
2. Use the `PublicClientApplicationBuilder` class to build out the authorization context.
    
    ```C#
    var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
        .Create(_clientId)
        .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, _tenantId)
        .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost")
        .Build();
    ```

|Code|Description|
|---|---|
|`.Create`|Creates a `PublicClientApplicationBuilder` from a clientID.|
|`.WithAuthority`|Adds a known Authority corresponding to an ADFS server. In the code we're specifying the Public cloud, and using the tenant for the app we registered.|
### Acquire a token

When you registered the _az204appreg_ app, it automatically generated an API permission `user.read` for Microsoft Graph. You use that permission to acquire a token.

1. Set the permission scope for the token request. Add the following code below the `PublicClientApplicationBuilder`.
    
    ```C#
    string[] scopes = { "user.read" };
    ```
    
2. Add code to request the token and write the result out to the console.
    
    ```C#
    AuthenticationResult result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes).ExecuteAsync();
    
    Console.WriteLine($"Token:\t{result.AccessToken}");
    ```

## Review completed application

The contents of the _Program.cs_ file should resemble the following example:

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;

namespace az204_auth
{
    class Program
    {
        private const string _clientId = "APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID";
        private const string _tenantId = "DIRECTORY_TENANT_ID";

        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
                .Create(_clientId)
                .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, _tenantId)
                .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost")
                .Build(); 
            string[] scopes = { "user.read" };
            AuthenticationResult result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes).ExecuteAsync();

            Console.WriteLine($"Token:\t{result.AccessToken}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Run the application

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal run `dotnet build` to check for errors, then `dotnet run` to run the app.
2. The app opens the default browser prompting you to select the account you want to authenticate with. If there are multiple accounts listed select the one associated with the tenant used in the app.
3. If this is the first time you've authenticated to the registered app you receive a **Permissions requested** notification asking you to approve the app to read data associated with your account. Select **Accept**.
    
    ![[Pasted image 20240224182636.png]]
    
4. You should see the results similar to the example below in the console.
    
    ```
    Token:  eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6IlVhU.....
    ```
