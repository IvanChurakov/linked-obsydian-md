# Explore Azure Key Vault

The Azure Key Vault service supports two types of containers: vaults and managed hardware security module(HSM) pools. Vaults support storing software and HSM-backed keys, secrets, and certificates. Managed HSM pools only support HSM-backed keys.

Azure Key Vault helps solve the following problems:

- **Secrets Management:** Azure Key Vault can be used to Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets
- **Key Management:** Azure Key Vault can also be used as a Key Management solution. Azure Key Vault makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
- **Certificate Management:** Azure Key Vault is also a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with Azure and your internal connected resources.

Azure Key Vault has two service tiers: Standard, which encrypts with a software key, and a Premium tier, which includes hardware security module(HSM)-protected keys. To see a comparison between the Standard and Premium tiers, see the [Azure Key Vault pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/).

# Discover Azure Key Vault best practices

Azure Key Vault is a tool for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. A vault is logical group of secrets.

## Authentication

To do any operations with Key Vault, you first need to authenticate to it. There are three ways to authenticate to Key Vault:

- **Managed identities for Azure resources**: When you deploy an app on a virtual machine in Azure, you can assign an identity to your virtual machine that has access to Key Vault. You can also assign identities to other Azure resources. The benefit of this approach is that the app or service isn't managing the rotation of the first secret. Azure automatically rotates the service principal client secret associated with the identity. We recommend this approach as a best practice.
- **Service principal and certificate**: You can use a service principal and an associated certificate that has access to Key Vault. We don't recommend this approach because the application owner or developer must rotate the certificate.
- **Service principal and secret**: Although you can use a service principal and a secret to authenticate to Key Vault, we don't recommend it. It's hard to automatically rotate the bootstrap secret that's used to authenticate to Key Vault.

## Encryption of data in transit

Azure Key Vault enforces Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to protect data when it’s traveling between Azure Key Vault and clients. Clients negotiate a TLS connection with Azure Key Vault. TLS provides strong authentication, message privacy, and integrity (enabling detection of message tampering, interception, and forgery), interoperability, algorithm flexibility, and ease of deployment and use.

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) protects connections between customers’ client systems and Microsoft cloud services by unique keys. Connections also use RSA-based 2,048-bit encryption key lengths. This combination makes it difficult for someone to intercept and access data that is in transit.

## Azure Key Vault best practices

- **Use separate key vaults:** Recommended using a vault per application per environment (Development, Pre-Production and Production). This pattern helps you not share secrets across environments and also reduces the threat if there is a breach.
- **Control access to your vault:** Key Vault data is sensitive and business critical, you need to secure access to your key vaults by allowing only authorized applications and users.
- **Backup:** Create regular back ups of your vault on update/delete/create of objects within a Vault.
- **Logging:** Be sure to turn on logging and alerts.
- **Recovery options:** Turn on [soft-delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview) and purge protection if you want to guard against force deletion of the secret.

# Authenticate to Azure Key Vault

Authentication with Key Vault works with Microsoft Entra ID, which is responsible for authenticating the identity of any given security principal.

For applications, there are two ways to obtain a service principal:

- Enable a system-assigned **managed identity** for the application. With managed identity, Azure internally manages the application's service principal and automatically authenticates the application with other Azure services. Managed identity is available for applications deployed to various services.
- If you can't use managed identity, you instead register the application with your Microsoft Entra tenant. Registration also creates a second application object that identifies the app across all tenants.

#### Note
It is recommended to use a system-assigned managed identity.

The following is information on authenticating to Key Vault without using a managed identity.

## Authentication to Key Vault in application code

Key Vault SDK is using Azure Identity client library, which allows seamless authentication to Key Vault across environments with same code. The table below provides information on the Azure Identity client libraries:

## Authentication to Key Vault with REST

Access tokens must be sent to the service using the HTTP Authorization header:

```HTTP
PUT /keys/MYKEY?api-version=<api_version>  HTTP/1.1  
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

When an access token isn't supplied, or when a token isn't accepted by the service, an `HTTP 401` error is returned to the client and will include the `WWW-Authenticate` header, for example:

```
401 Not Authorized  
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer authorization="…", resource="…"
```

The parameters on the `WWW-Authenticate` header are:

- authorization: The address of the OAuth2 authorization service that may be used to obtain an access token for the request.
- resource: The name of the resource (`https://vault.azure.net`) to use in the authorization request.

# Exercise: Set and retrieve a secret from Azure Key Vault by using Azure CLI

In this exercise you learn how to perform the following actions by using the Azure CLI:

- Create a Key Vault
- Add and retrieve a secret

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure account** with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free)

## Sign in to Azure and start the Cloud Shell

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and open the Cloud Shell.
    
    ![[Pasted image 20240225161307.png]]
    
2. When the shell opens be sure to select the **Bash** environment.
    
    ![[Pasted image 20240225161324.png]]

## Create a Key Vault

1. Let's set some variables for the CLI commands to use to reduce the amount of retyping. Replace the `<myLocation>` variable string with a region that makes sense for you. The Key Vault name needs to be a globally unique name, and the following script generates a random string.
    
    ```Bash
    myKeyVault=az204vault-$RANDOM
    myLocation=<myLocation>
    ```
    
2. Create a resource group.
    
    ```Bash
    az group create --name az204-vault-rg --location $myLocation
    ```
    
3. Create a Key Vault by using the `az keyvault create` command.
    
    ```Bash
    az keyvault create --name $myKeyVault --resource-group az204-vault-rg --location $myLocation
    ```

## Add and retrieve a secret

To add a secret to the vault, you just need to take a couple of extra steps.

1. Create a secret. Let's add a password that could be used by an app. The password is called **ExamplePassword** and will store the value of **hVFkk965BuUv** in it.
    
    ```Bash
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name $myKeyVault --name "ExamplePassword" --value "hVFkk965BuUv"
    ```
    
2. Use the `az keyvault secret show` command to retrieve the secret.
    
    ```Bash
    az keyvault secret show --name "ExamplePassword" --vault-name $myKeyVault
    ```
    
    This command returns some JSON. The last line contains the password in plain text.
    
    ```Json
    "value": "hVFkk965BuUv"
    ```

You've created a Key Vault, stored a secret, and retrieved it.

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the resources in this exercise use the following command to delete the resource group and associated Key Vault.

```Bash
az group delete --name az204-vault-rg --no-wait 
```
