# Explore Microsoft .NET SDK v3 for Azure Cosmos DB

This **unit** focuses on Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK v3 for API for NoSQL. (**Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos** NuGet package.) If you're familiar with the previous version of the .NET SDK, you may be used to the terms collection and document.

The [azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/tree/master/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage) GitHub repository includes the latest .NET sample solutions. You use these solutions to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) and other common operations on Azure Cosmos DB resources.

Because Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple API models, version 3 of the .NET SDK uses the generic terms "container" and "item". A _**container**_ can be a collection, graph, or table. An _**item**_ can be a document, edge/vertex, or row, and is the content inside a container.

Below are examples showing some of the key operations you should be familiar with. For more examples, please visit the GitHub link shown earlier. The examples below all use the async version of the methods.

## CosmosClient

Creates a new `CosmosClient` with a connection string. `CosmosClient` is thread-safe. It's recommended to maintain a single instance of `CosmosClient` per lifetime of the application that enables efficient connection management and performance.

```C#
CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
```

## Database examples

### Create a database

The `CosmosClient.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync` checks if a database exists, and if it doesn't, creates it. Only the database `id` is used to verify if there's an existing database.

```C#
// An object containing relevant information about the response
DatabaseResponse databaseResponse = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseId, 10000);
```

### Read a database by ID

Reads a database from the Azure Cosmos DB service as an asynchronous operation.

```C#
DatabaseResponse readResponse = await database.ReadAsync();
```

### Delete a database

Delete a Database as an asynchronous operation.

```C#
await database.DeleteAsync();
```

### Create a container

The `Database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync` method checks if a container exists, and if it doesn't, it creates it. Only the container `id` is used to verify if there's an existing container.

```C#
// Set throughput to the minimum value of 400 RU/s
ContainerResponse simpleContainer = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(
    id: containerId,
    partitionKeyPath: partitionKey,
    throughput: 400);
```

### Get a container by ID

```C#
Container container = database.GetContainer(containerId);
ContainerProperties containerProperties = await container.ReadContainerAsync();
```

### Delete a container

Delete a Container as an asynchronous operation.

```C#
await database.GetContainer(containerId).DeleteContainerAsync();
```

## Item examples

### Create an item

Use the `Container.CreateItemAsync` method to create an item. The method requires a JSON serializable object that must contain an `id` property, and a `partitionKey`.

```C#
ItemResponse<SalesOrder> response = await container.CreateItemAsync(salesOrder, new PartitionKey(salesOrder.AccountNumber));
```

### Read an item

Use the `Container.ReadItemAsync` method to read an item. The method requires type to serialize the item to along with an `id` property, and a `partitionKey`.

```C#
string id = "[id]";
string accountNumber = "[partition-key]";
ItemResponse<SalesOrder> response = await container.ReadItemAsync(id, new PartitionKey(accountNumber));
```

### Query an item

The `Container.GetItemQueryIterator` method creates a query for items under a container in an Azure Cosmos database using a SQL statement with parameterized values. It returns a `FeedIterator`.

```C#
QueryDefinition query = new QueryDefinition(
    "select * from sales s where s.AccountNumber = @AccountInput ")
    .WithParameter("@AccountInput", "Account1");

FeedIterator<SalesOrder> resultSet = container.GetItemQueryIterator<SalesOrder>(
    query,
    requestOptions: new QueryRequestOptions()
    {
        PartitionKey = new PartitionKey("Account1"),
        MaxItemCount = 1
    });
```

# Exercise: Create resources by using the Microsoft .NET SDK v3

In this exercise you create a console app to perform the following operations in Azure Cosmos DB:

- Connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account
- Create a database
- Create a container

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) is the target framework for the exercise.
- The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) for Visual Studio Code.
- The latest [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) tools, installed locally

## Setting up

Perform the following actions to prepare Azure, and your local environment, for the exercise.

### Connecting to Azure

1. Start Visual Studio Code and open a terminal window by selecting **Terminal** from the top application bar, then choosing **New Terminal**.
2. Sign in to Azure by using the following command. A browser window should open letting you choose which account to sign in with.
    
    ```Bash
    az login
    ```

### Create resources in Azure

1. Create a resource group for the resources needed for this exercise. Replace `<myLocation>` with a region near you.
    
    ```Bash
    az group create --location <myLocation> --name az204-cosmos-rg
    ```
    
2. Create the Azure Cosmos DB account. Replace `<myCosmosDBacct>` with a _unique_ name to identify your Azure Cosmos DB account. The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must be between 3-31 characters in length. _This command takes a few minutes to complete._
    
    ```Bash
    az cosmosdb create --name <myCosmosDBacct> --resource-group az204-cosmos-rg
    ```
    
    Record the `documentEndpoint` shown in the JSON response, it's used later in the exercise.
    
3. Retrieve the primary key for the account by using the following command. Record the `primaryMasterKey` from the command results it will be used in the code.
    
    ```Bash
    # Retrieve the primary key
    az cosmosdb keys list --name <myCosmosDBacct> --resource-group az204-cosmos-rg
    ```

### Set up the console application

Now that the needed resources are deployed to Azure the next step is to set up the console application using the same terminal window in Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a folder for the project and change in to the folder.
    
    ```Bash
    md az204-cosmos
    cd az204-cosmos
    ```
    
2. Create the .NET console app.
    
    ```Bash
    dotnet new console
    ```
    
3. Open the current folder in Visual Studio Code using the following command. The `-r` option opens the folder without launching a new Visual Studio Code window.
    
    ```Bash
    code . -r
    ```
    
4. Select the _Program.cs_ file in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

## Build the console app

It's time to start adding the packages and code to the project.

### Add packages and using statements

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and use the following command to add the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` package to the project.
    
    ```Bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos
    ```
    
2. Delete any existing code in the `Program.cs` file and add the `using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` statement.
    
    ```C#
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
    ```

### Add code to connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account

1. Add the following code snippet after the `using` statement. The code snippet adds constants and variables into the class and adds some error checking. Be sure to replace the placeholder values for `EndpointUri` and `PrimaryKey` following the directions in the code comments.
    
    ```C#
    public class Program
    {
        // Replace <documentEndpoint> with the information created earlier
        private static readonly string EndpointUri = "<documentEndpoint>";
    
        // Set variable to the Primary Key from earlier.
        private static readonly string PrimaryKey = "<your primary key>";
    
        // The Cosmos client instance
        private CosmosClient cosmosClient;
    
        // The database we will create
        private Database database;
    
        // The container we will create.
        private Container container;
    
        // The names of the database and container we will create
        private string databaseId = "az204Database";
        private string containerId = "az204Container";
    
        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Beginning operations...\n");
                Program p = new Program();
                await p.CosmosAsync();
    
            }
            catch (CosmosException de)
            {
                Exception baseException = de.GetBaseException();
                Console.WriteLine("{0} error occurred: {1}", de.StatusCode, de);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error: {0}", e);
            }
            finally
            {
                Console.WriteLine("End of program, press any key to exit.");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
        }
        //The sample code below gets added below this line
    }
    ```
    
2. Below the `Main` method, add a new asynchronous task called `CosmosAsync`, which instantiates our new `CosmosClient` and adds code to call the methods you add later to create a database and a container.
    
    ```C#
    public async Task CosmosAsync()
    {
        // Create a new instance of the Cosmos Client
        this.cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(EndpointUri, PrimaryKey);
    
        // Runs the CreateDatabaseAsync method
        await this.CreateDatabaseAsync();
    
        // Run the CreateContainerAsync method
        await this.CreateContainerAsync();
    }
    ```

## Create a database

Copy and paste the `CreateDatabaseAsync` method after the `CosmosAsync` method. `CreateDatabaseAsync` creates a new database with ID `az204Database` if it doesn't already exist.

```C#
private async Task CreateDatabaseAsync()
{
    // Create a new database using the cosmosClient
    this.database = await this.cosmosClient.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseId);
    Console.WriteLine("Created Database: {0}\n", this.database.Id);
}
```

## Create a container

Copy and paste the `CreateContainerAsync` method below the `CreateDatabaseAsync` method.

```C#
private async Task CreateContainerAsync()
{
    // Create a new container
    this.container = await this.database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(containerId, "/LastName");
    Console.WriteLine("Created Container: {0}\n", this.container.Id);
}
```

## Run the application

1. Save your work and, in a terminal in Visual Studio Code, run the `dotnet build` command to check for any errors. If the build is successful run the `dotnet run` command. The console displays the following messages.
    
    ```
    Beginning operations...
    
    Created Database: az204Database
    
    Created Container: az204Container
    
    End of program, press any key to exit.
    ```
    
2. Verify the results by opening the Azure portal, navigating to your Azure Cosmos DB resource, and use the **Data Explorer** to view the database and container.

## Clean up Azure resources

You can now safely delete the _az204-cosmos-rg_ resource group from your account by running the following command.

```Bash
az group delete --name az204-cosmos-rg --no-wait
```

# Create stored procedures

Azure Cosmos DB provides language-integrated, transactional execution of JavaScript that lets you write **stored procedures**, **triggers**, and **user-defined functions (UDFs)**. To call a stored procedure, trigger, or user-defined function, you need to register it. For more information, see [How to work with stored procedures, triggers, user-defined functions in Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs).

### Note
This unit focuses on stored procedures, the following unit covers triggers and user-defined functions.

## Writing stored procedures

Stored procedures can create, update, read, query, and delete items inside an Azure Cosmos container. Stored procedures are registered per collection, and can operate on any document or an attachment present in that collection.

Here's a simple stored procedure that returns a "Hello World" response.

```JavaScript
var helloWorldStoredProc = {
    id: "helloWorld",
    serverScript: function () {
        var context = getContext();
        var response = context.getResponse();

        response.setBody("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

The context object provides access to all operations that can be performed in Azure Cosmos DB, and access to the request and response objects. In this case, you use the response object to set the body of the response to be sent back to the client.

## Create an item using stored procedure

When you create an item by using stored procedure, it's inserted into the Azure Cosmos container and an ID for the newly created item is returned. Creating an item is an asynchronous operation and depends on the JavaScript callback functions. The callback function has two parameters:

- The error object in case the operation fails
- A return value

Inside the callback, you can either handle the exception or throw an error. In case a callback isn't provided and there's an error, the Azure Cosmos DB runtime throws an error.

The stored procedure also includes a parameter to set the description, it's a boolean value. When the parameter is set to true and the description is missing, the stored procedure throws an exception. Otherwise, the rest of the stored procedure continues to run.

This stored procedure takes as input `documentToCreate`, the body of a document to be created in the current collection. All such operations are asynchronous and depend on JavaScript function callbacks. The callback function has two parameters, one for the error object in case the operation fails, and one for the created object. Inside the callback, users can either handle the exception or throw an error. In case a callback isn't provided and there's an error, the DocumentDB runtime throws an error.

```JavaScript
var createDocumentStoredProc = {
    id: "createMyDocument",
    body: function createMyDocument(documentToCreate) {
        var context = getContext();
        var collection = context.getCollection();
        var accepted = collection.createDocument(collection.getSelfLink(),
              documentToCreate,
              function (err, documentCreated) {
                  if (err) throw new Error('Error' + err.message);
                  context.getResponse().setBody(documentCreated.id)
              });
        if (!accepted) return;
    }
}
```

## Arrays as input parameters for stored procedures

When defining a stored procedure in the Azure portal, input parameters are always sent as a string to the stored procedure. Even if you pass an array of strings as an input, the array is converted to string and sent to the stored procedure. To work around this, you can define a function within your stored procedure to parse the string as an array. The following code shows how to parse a string input parameter as an array:

```JavaScript
function sample(arr) {
    if (typeof arr === "string") arr = JSON.parse(arr);

    arr.forEach(function(a) {
        // do something here
        console.log(a);
    });
}
```

## Bounded execution

All Azure Cosmos DB operations must complete within a limited amount of time. Stored procedures have a limited amount of time to run on the server. All collection functions return a Boolean value that represents whether that operation completes or not

## Transactions within stored procedures

You can implement transactions on items within a container by using a stored procedure. JavaScript functions can implement a continuation-based model to batch or resume execution. The continuation value can be any value of your choice and your applications can then use this value to resume a transaction from a new starting point. The diagram below depicts how the transaction continuation model can be used to repeat a server-side function until the function finishes its entire processing workload.

# Create triggers and user-defined functions

Azure Cosmos DB supports pretriggers and post-triggers. Pretriggers are executed before modifying a database item and post-triggers are executed after modifying a database item. Triggers aren't automatically executed, they must be specified for each database operation where you want them to execute. After you define a trigger, you should register it by using the Azure Cosmos DB SDKs.

For examples of how to register and call a trigger, see [pretriggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#pre-triggers) and [post-triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#post-triggers).

## Pretriggers

The following example shows how a pretrigger is used to validate the properties of an Azure Cosmos item that is being created, it adds a timestamp property to a newly added item if it doesn't contain one.

```JavaScript
function validateToDoItemTimestamp() {
    var context = getContext();
    var request = context.getRequest();

    // item to be created in the current operation
    var itemToCreate = request.getBody();

    // validate properties
    if (!("timestamp" in itemToCreate)) {
        var ts = new Date();
        itemToCreate["timestamp"] = ts.getTime();
    }

    // update the item that will be created
    request.setBody(itemToCreate);
}
```

Pretriggers can't have any input parameters. The request object in the trigger is used to manipulate the request message associated with the operation. In the previous example, the pretrigger is run when creating an Azure Cosmos item, and the request message body contains the item to be created in JSON format.

When triggers are registered, you can specify the operations that it can run with. This trigger should be created with a `TriggerOperation` value of `TriggerOperation.Create`, which means using the trigger in a replace operation isn't permitted.

For examples of how to register and call a pretrigger, visit the [pretriggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-use-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#pre-triggers) article.

## Post-triggers

The following example shows a post-trigger. This trigger queries for the metadata item and updates it with details about the newly created item.

```JavaScript
function updateMetadata() {
var context = getContext();
var container = context.getCollection();
var response = context.getResponse();

// item that was created
var createdItem = response.getBody();

// query for metadata document
var filterQuery = 'SELECT * FROM root r WHERE r.id = "_metadata"';
var accept = container.queryDocuments(container.getSelfLink(), filterQuery,
    updateMetadataCallback);
if(!accept) throw "Unable to update metadata, abort";

function updateMetadataCallback(err, items, responseOptions) {
    if(err) throw new Error("Error" + err.message);
        if(items.length != 1) throw 'Unable to find metadata document';

        var metadataItem = items[0];

        // update metadata
        metadataItem.createdItems += 1;
        metadataItem.createdNames += " " + createdItem.id;
        var accept = container.replaceDocument(metadataItem._self,
            metadataItem, function(err, itemReplaced) {
                    if(err) throw "Unable to update metadata, abort";
            });
        if(!accept) throw "Unable to update metadata, abort";
        return;
    }
}
```

One thing that is important to note is the transactional execution of triggers in Azure Cosmos DB. The post-trigger runs as part of the same transaction for the underlying item itself. An exception during the post-trigger execution fails the whole transaction. Anything committed is rolled back and an exception returned.

## User-defined functions

The following sample creates a UDF to calculate income tax for various income brackets. This user-defined function would then be used inside a query. For the purposes of this example assume there's a container called "Incomes" with properties as follows:

```Json
{
   "name": "User One",
   "country": "USA",
   "income": 70000
}
```

The following is a function definition to calculate income tax for various income brackets:

```JavaScript
function tax(income) {

        if(income == undefined)
            throw 'no input';

        if (income < 1000)
            return income * 0.1;
        else if (income < 10000)
            return income * 0.2;
        else
            return income * 0.4;
    }
```

# Explore change feed in Azure Cosmos DB

Change feed in Azure Cosmos DB is a persistent record of changes to a container in the order they occur. Change feed support in Azure Cosmos DB works by listening to an Azure Cosmos DB container for any changes. It then outputs the sorted list of documents that were changed in the order in which they were modified. The persisted changes can be processed asynchronously and incrementally, and the output can be distributed across one or more consumers for parallel processing.

## Change feed and different operations

Today, you see all inserts and updates in the change feed. You can't filter the change feed for a specific type of operation. Currently change feed doesn't log delete operations. As a workaround, you can add a soft marker on the items that are being deleted. For example, you can add an attribute in the item called "deleted," set its value to "true," and then set a time-to-live (TTL) value on the item. Setting the TTL ensures that the item is automatically deleted.

## Reading Azure Cosmos DB change feed

You can work with the Azure Cosmos DB change feed using either a push model or a pull model. With a push model, the change feed processor pushes work to a client that has business logic for processing this work. However, the complexity in checking for work and storing state for the last processed work is handled within the change feed processor.

With a pull model, the client has to pull the work from the server. The client, in this case, not only has business logic for processing work but also storing state for the last processed work, handling load balancing across multiple clients processing work in parallel, and handling errors.

### Note
It is recommended to use the push model because you won't need to worry about polling the change feed for future changes, storing state for the last processed change, and other benefits.

Most scenarios that use the Azure Cosmos DB change feed use one of the push model options. However, there are some scenarios where you might want the additional low level control of the pull model. These include:

- Reading changes from a particular partition key
- Controlling the pace at which your client receives changes for processing
- Doing a one-time read of the existing data in the change feed (for example, to do a data migration)

### Note
It is recommended to use the push model because you won't need to worry about polling the change feed for future changes, storing state for the last processed change, and other benefits.

## Reading change feed with a push model

There are two ways you can read from the change feed with a push model: Azure Functions Azure Cosmos DB triggers, and the change feed processor library. Azure Functions uses the change feed processor behind the scenes, so these are both similar ways to read the change feed. Think of Azure Functions as simply a hosting platform for the change feed processor, not an entirely different way of reading the change feed. Azure Functions uses the change feed processor behind the scenes, it automatically parallelizes change processing across your container's partitions.

### Azure Functions

You can create small reactive Azure Functions that will be automatically triggered on each new event in your Azure Cosmos DB container's change feed. With the [Azure Functions trigger for Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger), you can use the Change Feed Processor's scaling and reliable event detection functionality without the need to maintain any worker infrastructure.

![[Pasted image 20240221192902.png | center]]

### Change feed processor

The change feed processor is part of the Azure Cosmos DB [.NET V3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3) and [Java V4](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/cosmos/azure-cosmos) SDKs. It simplifies the process of reading the change feed and distributes the event processing across multiple consumers effectively.

There are four main components of implementing the change feed processor:

1. **The monitored container**: The monitored container has the data from which the change feed is generated. Any inserts and updates to the monitored container are reflected in the change feed of the container.
2. **The lease container**: The lease container acts as a state storage and coordinates processing the change feed across multiple workers. The lease container can be stored in the same account as the monitored container or in a separate account.
3. **The compute instance**: A compute instance hosts the change feed processor to listen for changes. Depending on the platform, it could be represented by a VM, a kubernetes pod, an Azure App Service instance, an actual physical machine. It has a unique identifier referenced as the instance name throughout this article.
4. **The delegate**: The delegate is the code that defines what you, the developer, want to do with each batch of changes that the change feed processor reads.

When implementing the change feed processor the point of entry is always the monitored container, from a `Container` instance you call `GetChangeFeedProcessorBuilder`:

```C#
/// <summary>
/// Start the Change Feed Processor to listen for changes and process them with the HandleChangesAsync implementation.
/// </summary>
private static async Task<ChangeFeedProcessor> StartChangeFeedProcessorAsync(
    CosmosClient cosmosClient,
    IConfiguration configuration)
{
    string databaseName = configuration["SourceDatabaseName"];
    string sourceContainerName = configuration["SourceContainerName"];
    string leaseContainerName = configuration["LeasesContainerName"];

    Container leaseContainer = cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseName, leaseContainerName);
    ChangeFeedProcessor changeFeedProcessor = cosmosClient.GetContainer(databaseName, sourceContainerName)
        .GetChangeFeedProcessorBuilder<ToDoItem>(processorName: "changeFeedSample", onChangesDelegate: HandleChangesAsync)
            .WithInstanceName("consoleHost")
            .WithLeaseContainer(leaseContainer)
            .Build();

    Console.WriteLine("Starting Change Feed Processor...");
    await changeFeedProcessor.StartAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Change Feed Processor started.");
    return changeFeedProcessor;
}
```

Where the first parameter is a distinct name that describes the goal of this processor and the second name is the delegate implementation that will handle changes. Following is an example of a delegate:

/// <summary>
/// The delegate receives batches of changes as they are generated in the change feed and can process them.
/// </summary>
static async Task HandleChangesAsync(
    ChangeFeedProcessorContext context,
    IReadOnlyCollection<ToDoItem> changes,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Started handling changes for lease {context.LeaseToken}...");
    Console.WriteLine($"Change Feed request consumed {context.Headers.RequestCharge} RU.");
    // SessionToken if needed to enforce Session consistency on another client instance
    Console.WriteLine($"SessionToken ${context.Headers.Session}");

    // We may want to track any operation's Diagnostics that took longer than some threshold
    if (context.Diagnostics.GetClientElapsedTime() > TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Change Feed request took longer than expected. Diagnostics:" + context.Diagnostics.ToString());
    }

    foreach (ToDoItem item in changes)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Detected operation for item with id {item.id}, created at {item.creationTime}.");
        // Simulate some asynchronous operation
        await Task.Delay(10);
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Finished handling changes.");
}
```

Afterwards, you define the compute instance name or unique identifier with `WithInstanceName`, this should be unique and different in each compute instance you're deploying, and finally, which is the container to maintain the lease state with `WithLeaseContainer`.

Calling `Build` gives you the processor instance that you can start by calling `StartAsync`.

The normal life cycle of a host instance is:

1. Read the change feed.
2. If there are no changes, sleep for a predefined amount of time (customizable with `WithPollInterval` in the `Builder`) and go to #1.
3. If there are changes, send them to the delegate.
4. When the delegate finishes processing the changes successfully, update the lease store with the latest processed point in time and go to #1.

1. When defining a stored procedure in the Azure portal input parameters are always sent as what type to the stored procedure?

- [x] String
- [ ] Integer
- [ ] Boolean

2. Which of the following would one use to validate properties of an item being created?

- [x] Pretrigger
- [ ] Post-trigger
- [ ] User-defined function
