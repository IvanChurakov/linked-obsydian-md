# Explore Azure Container Instances

Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a great solution for any scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs. Here are some of the benefits:

- **Fast startup**: ACI can start containers in Azure in seconds, without the need to provision and manage VMs
- **Container access**: ACI enables exposing your container groups directly to the internet with an IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
- **Hypervisor-level security**: Isolate your application as completely as it would be in a VM
- **Customer data**: The ACI service stores the minimum customer data required to ensure your container groups are running as expected
- **Custom sizes**: ACI provides optimum utilization by allowing exact specifications of CPU cores and memory
- **Persistent storage**: Mount Azure Files shares directly to a container to retrieve and persist state
- **Linux and Windows**: Schedule both Windows and Linux containers using the same API.

For scenarios where you need full container orchestration, including service discovery across multiple containers, automatic scaling, and coordinated application upgrades, we recommend [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/).

The top-level resource in Azure Container Instances is the _container group_. A container group is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes. It's similar in concept to a _pod_ in Kubernetes.

The following diagram shows an example of a container group that includes multiple containers:

![[Pasted image 20240222193516.png | center]]

This example container group:

- Is scheduled on a single host machine.
- Is assigned a DNS name label.
- Exposes a single public IP address, with one exposed port.
- Consists of two containers. One container listens on port 80, while the other listens on port 5000.
- Includes two Azure file shares as volume mounts, and each container mounts one of the shares locally.

### Note
Multi-container groups currently support only Linux containers. For Windows containers, Azure Container Instances only supports deployment of a single instance.

## Deployment

There are two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: use a Resource Manager template or a YAML file. A Resource Manager template is recommended when you need to deploy more Azure service resources (for example, an Azure Files share) when you deploy the container instances. Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances.

## Resource allocation

Azure Container Instances allocates resources such as CPUs, memory, and optionally GPUs (preview) to a container group by adding the resource requests of the instances in the group. Using CPU resources as an example, if you create a container group with two instances, each requesting one CPU, then the container group is allocated two CPUs.

## Networking

Container groups share an IP address and a port namespace on that IP address. To enable external clients to reach a container within the group, you must expose the port on the IP address and from the container. Because containers within the group share a port namespace, port mapping isn't supported. Containers within a group can reach each other via localhost on the ports that they exposed, even if those ports aren't exposed externally on the group's IP address.

## Storage

You can specify external volumes to mount within a container group. You can map those volumes into specific paths within the individual containers in a group. Supported volumes include:

- Azure file share
- Secret
- Empty directory
- Cloned git repo

## Common scenarios

Multi-container groups are useful in cases where you want to divide a single functional task into a few container images. These images might be delivered by different teams and have separate resource requirements.

Example usage could include:

- A container serving a web application and a container pulling the latest content from source control.
- An application container and a logging container. The logging container collects the logs and metrics output by the main application and writes them to long-term storage.
- An application container and a monitoring container. The monitoring container periodically makes a request to the application to ensure that it's running and responding correctly, and raises an alert if it's not.
- A front-end container and a back-end container. The front end might serve a web application, with the back end running a service to retrieve data.

# Exercise - Deploy a container instance by using the Azure CLI

Completed100 XP

- 10 minutes

In this exercise you learn how to perform the following actions:

- Create a resource group for the container
- Create a container
- Verify the container is running

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure account** with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free)

## Sign-in to Azure and create the resource group

1. Sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and open the Cloud Shell.
    
    ![[Pasted image 20240222194116.png]]
    
2. When the shell opens be sure to select the **Bash** environment.
    
    ![[Pasted image 20240222194135.png]]
    
3. Create a new resource group with the name **az204-aci-rg** so that it's easier to clean up these resources when you're finished with the module. Replace `<myLocation>` with a region near you.
    
    ```Bash
    az group create --name az204-aci-rg --location <myLocation>
    ```

## Create a container

You create a container by providing a name, a Docker image, and an Azure resource group to the `az container create` command. You expose the container to the Internet by specifying a DNS name label.

1. Create a DNS name to expose your container to the Internet. Your DNS name must be unique, run this command from Cloud Shell to create a variable that holds a unique name.
    
    ```Bash
    DNS_NAME_LABEL=aci-example-$RANDOM
    ```
    
2. Run the following `az container create` command to start a container instance. Be sure to replace the `<myLocation>` with the region you specified earlier. It takes a few minutes for the operation to complete.
    
    ```Bash
    az container create --resource-group az204-aci-rg \
        --name mycontainer \
        --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld \
        --ports 80 \
        --dns-name-label $DNS_NAME_LABEL --location <myLocation> 
    ```
    
    In the previous command, `$DNS_NAME_LABEL` specifies your DNS name. The image name, `mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld`, refers to a Docker image that runs a basic Node.js web application.

## Verify the container is running

1. When the `az container create` command completes, run `az container show` to check its status.
    
    ```Bash
    az container show --resource-group az204-aci-rg \
        --name mycontainer \
        --query "{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}" \
        --out table 
    ```
    
    You see your container's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and its provisioning state. Here's an example.
    
    ```
    FQDN                                    ProvisioningState
    --------------------------------------  -------------------
    aci-wt.eastus.azurecontainer.io         Succeeded
    ```
    
2. From a browser, navigate to your container's FQDN to see it running. You may get a warning that the site isn't safe.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the `az group delete` command to remove the resource group, the container registry, and the container images stored there.

```Bash
az group delete --name az204-aci-rg --no-wait
```

# Run containerized tasks with restart policies

The ease and speed of deploying containers in Azure Container Instances provides a compelling platform for executing run-once tasks like build, test, and image rendering in a container instance.

With a configurable restart policy, you can specify that your containers are stopped when their processes are completed. Because container instances are billed by the second, you're charged only for the compute resources used while the container executing your task is running.

## Container restart policy

When you create a container group in Azure Container Instances, you can specify one of three restart policy settings.

|Restart policy|Description|
|---|---|
|`Always`|Containers in the container group are always restarted. This is the **default** setting applied when no restart policy is specified at container creation.|
|`Never`|Containers in the container group are never restarted. The containers run at most once.|
|`OnFailure`|Containers in the container group are restarted only when the process executed in the container fails (when it terminates with a nonzero exit code). The containers are run at least once.|
## Specify a restart policy

Specify the `--restart-policy` parameter when you call `az container create`.

```Bash
az container create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name mycontainer \
    --image mycontainerimage \
    --restart-policy OnFailure
```

## Run to completion

Azure Container Instances starts the container, and then stops it when its application, or script, exits. When Azure Container Instances stops a container whose restart policy is `Never` or `OnFailure`, the container's status is set to **Terminated**.

# Set environment variables in container instances

Setting environment variables in your container instances allows you to provide dynamic configuration of the application or script run by the container. These environment variables are similar to the `--env` command-line argument to `docker run`.

If you need to pass secrets as environment variables, Azure Container Instances supports secure values for both Windows and Linux containers.

In the following example, two variables are passed to the container when it's created. The example is assuming you're running the CLI in a Bash shell or Cloud Shell, if you use the Windows Command Prompt, specify the variables with double-quotes, such as `--environment-variables "NumWords"="5" "MinLength"="8"`.

```Bash
az container create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name mycontainer2 \
    --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-wordcount:latest 
    --restart-policy OnFailure \
    --environment-variables 'NumWords'='5' 'MinLength'='8'\
```

## Secure values

Objects with secure values are intended to hold sensitive information like passwords or keys for your application. Using secure values for environment variables is both safer and more flexible than including it in your container's image.

Environment variables with secure values aren't visible in your container's properties. Their values can be accessed only from within the container. For example, container properties viewed in the Azure portal or Azure CLI display only a secure variable's name, not its value.

Set a secure environment variable by specifying the `secureValue` property instead of the regular `value` for the variable's type. The two variables defined in the following YAML demonstrate the two variable types.

```YAML
apiVersion: 2018-10-01
location: eastus
name: securetest
properties:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    properties:
      environmentVariables:
        - name: 'NOTSECRET'
          value: 'my-exposed-value'
        - name: 'SECRET'
          secureValue: 'my-secret-value'
      image: nginx
      ports: []
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1.0
          memoryInGB: 1.5
  osType: Linux
  restartPolicy: Always
tags: null
type: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
```

You would run the following command to deploy the container group with YAML:

```Bash
az container create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --file secure-env.yaml \
```

# Mount an Azure file share in Azure Container Instances

By default, Azure Container Instances are stateless. If the container crashes or stops, all of its state is lost. To persist state beyond the lifetime of the container, you must mount a volume from an external store. As shown in this unit, Azure Container Instances can mount an Azure file share created with Azure Files. Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Using an Azure file share with Azure Container Instances provides file-sharing features similar to using an Azure file share with Azure virtual machines.

## Limitations

- You can only mount Azure Files shares to Linux containers.
- Azure file share volume mount requires the Linux container run as _root_.
- Azure File share volume mounts are limited to CIFS support.

## Deploy container and mount volume

To mount an Azure file share as a volume in a container by using the Azure CLI, specify the share and volume mount point when you create the container with `az container create`. Following is an example of the command:

```Bash
az container create \
    --resource-group $ACI_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name hellofiles \
    --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-hellofiles \
    --dns-name-label aci-demo \
    --ports 80 \
    --azure-file-volume-account-name $ACI_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --azure-file-volume-account-key $STORAGE_KEY \
    --azure-file-volume-share-name $ACI_PERS_SHARE_NAME \
    --azure-file-volume-mount-path /aci/logs/
```

The `--dns-name-label` value must be unique within the Azure region where you create the container instance. Update the value in the preceding command if you receive a **DNS name label** error message when you execute the command.

## Deploy container and mount volume - YAML

You can also deploy a container group and mount a volume in a container with the Azure CLI and a YAML template. Deploying by YAML template is the preferred method when deploying container groups consisting of multiple containers.

The following YAML template defines a container group with one container created with the `aci-hellofiles` image. The container mounts the Azure file share _acishare_ created previously as a volume. Following is an example YAML file.

```YAML
apiVersion: '2019-12-01'
location: eastus
name: file-share-demo
properties:
  containers:
  - name: hellofiles
    properties:
      environmentVariables: []
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-hellofiles
      ports:
      - port: 80
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1.0
          memoryInGB: 1.5
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /aci/logs/
        name: filesharevolume
  osType: Linux
  restartPolicy: Always
  ipAddress:
    type: Public
    ports:
      - port: 80
    dnsNameLabel: aci-demo
  volumes:
  - name: filesharevolume
    azureFile:
      sharename: acishare
      storageAccountName: <Storage account name>
      storageAccountKey: <Storage account key>
tags: {}
type: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
```

## Mount multiple volumes

To mount multiple volumes in a container instance, you must deploy using an Azure Resource Manager template or a YAML file. To use a template or YAML file, provide the share details and define the volumes by populating the `volumes` array in the `properties` section of the template.

For example, if you created two Azure Files shares named _share1_ and _share2_ in storage account _myStorageAccount_, the `volumes` array in a Resource Manager template would appear similar to the following:

```Json
"volumes": [{
  "name": "myvolume1",
  "azureFile": {
    "shareName": "share1",
    "storageAccountName": "myStorageAccount",
    "storageAccountKey": "<storage-account-key>"
  }
},
{
  "name": "myvolume2",
  "azureFile": {
    "shareName": "share2",
    "storageAccountName": "myStorageAccount",
    "storageAccountKey": "<storage-account-key>"
  }
}]
```

Next, for each container in the container group in which you'd like to mount the volumes, populate the `volumeMounts` array in the `properties` section of the container definition. For example, this mounts the two volumes, _myvolume1_ and _myvolume2_, previously defined:

```Json
"volumeMounts": [{
  "name": "myvolume1",
  "mountPath": "/mnt/share1/"
},
{
  "name": "myvolume2",
  "mountPath": "/mnt/share2/"
}]
```
