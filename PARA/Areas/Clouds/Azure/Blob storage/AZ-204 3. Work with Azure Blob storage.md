# Explore Azure Blob storage client library

The Azure Storage client libraries for .NET offer a convenient interface for making calls to Azure Storage. The latest version of the Azure Storage client library is version 12.x. Microsoft recommends using version 12.x for new applications.

The following table lists the basic classes, along with a brief description:

|Class|Description|
|---|---|
|`BlobServiceClient`|Represents the storage account, and provides operations to retrieve and configure account properties, and to work with blob containers in the storage account.|
|`BlobContainerClient`|Represents a specific blob container, and provides operations to work with the container and the blobs within.|
|`BlobClient`|Represents a specific blob, and provides general operations to work with the blob, including operations to upload, download, delete, and create snapshots.|
|`AppendBlobClient`|Represents an append blob, and provides operations specific to append blobs, such as appending log data.|
|`BlockBlobClient`|Represents a block blob, and provides operations specific to block blobs, such as staging and then committing blocks of data.|

The following packages contain the classes used to work with Blob Storage data resources:

- [Azure.Storage.Blobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs): Contains the primary classes (client objects) that you can use to operate on the service, containers, and blobs.
- [Azure.Storage.Blobs.Specialized](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized): Contains classes that you can use to perform operations specific to a blob type, such as block blobs.
- [Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.models): All other utility classes, structures, and enumeration types.

# Create a client object

Working with any Azure resource using the SDK begins with creating a client object. In this section, you learn how to create client objects to interact with the three types of resources in the storage service: storage accounts, containers, and blobs.

When your application creates a client object, you pass a URI referencing the endpoint to the client constructor. You can construct the endpoint string manually, as shown in the examples in this article, or you can query for the endpoint at runtime using the Azure Storage management library.

The code samples in this unit use [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) to authenticate to Azure via a Microsoft Entra security principal. The authentication process includes obtaining an access token for authorization. This access token is passed as a credential when the client is instantiated, and the credential persists throughout the client lifetime. The Microsoft Entra security principal requesting the token must be assigned an appropriate Azure RBAC role that grants access to blob data.

## Create a BlobServiceClient object

An authorized `BlobServiceClient` object allows your app to interact with resources at the storage account level. `BlobServiceClient` provides methods to retrieve and configure account properties, as well as list, create, and delete containers within the storage account. This client object is the starting point for interacting with resources in the storage account.

The following example shows how to create a `BlobServiceClient` object:

```C#
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;

public BlobServiceClient GetBlobServiceClient(string accountName)
{
    BlobServiceClient client = new(
        new Uri($"https://{accountName}.blob.core.windows.net"),
        new DefaultAzureCredential());

    return client;
}
```

## Create a BlobContainerClient object

You can use a `BlobServiceClient` object to create a new `BlobContainerClient` object. A `BlobContainerClient` object allows you to interact with a specific container resource. `BlobContainerClient` provides methods to create, delete, or configure a container, and includes methods to list, upload, and delete the blobs within it.

The following example shows how to create a container client from a `BlobServiceClient` object to interact with a specific container resource:

```C#
public BlobContainerClient GetBlobContainerClient(
    BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient,
    string containerName)
{
    // Create the container client using the service client object
    BlobContainerClient client = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient(containerName);
    return client;
}
```

If your work is narrowly scoped to a single container, you might choose to create a `BlobContainerClient` object directly without using `BlobServiceClient`.

```C#
public BlobContainerClient GetBlobContainerClient(
    string accountName,
    string containerName,
    BlobClientOptions clientOptions)
{
    // Append the container name to the end of the URI
    BlobContainerClient client = new(
        new Uri($"https://{accountName}.blob.core.windows.net/{containerName}"),
        new DefaultAzureCredential(),
        clientOptions);

    return client;
}
```

## Create a BlobClient object

To interact with a specific blob resource, create a `BlobClient` object from a service client or container client. A `BlobClient` object allows you to interact with a specific blob resource.

The following example shows how to create a blob client to interact with a specific blob resource:

```C#
public BlobClient GetBlobClient(
    BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient,
    string containerName,
    string blobName)
{
    BlobClient client =
        blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient(containerName).GetBlobClient(blobName);
    return client;
}
```

# Exercise: Create Blob storage resources by using the .NET client library

This exercise uses the Azure Blob storage client library to show you how to perform the following actions on Azure Blob storage in a console app:

- Create a container
- Upload blobs to a container
- List the blobs in a container
- Download blobs
- Delete a container

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).
- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) is the target framework for the steps below.
- The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) for Visual Studio Code.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Setting up

Perform the following actions to prepare Azure, and your local environment, for the exercise.

1. Start Visual Studio Code and open a terminal window by selecting **Terminal** from the top application bar, then selecting **New Terminal**.
2. Login to Azure by using the command below. A browser window should open letting you choose which account to login with.
    
    ```Bash
    az login
    ```
    
3. Create a resource group for the resources needed for this exercise. Replace `<myLocation>` with a region near you.
    
    ```Bash
    az group create --location <myLocation> --name az204-blob-rg
    ```
    
4. Create a storage account. We need a storage account created to use in the application. Replace `<myLocation>` with the same region you used for the resource group. Replace `<myStorageAcct>` with a unique name.
    
    ```Bash
    az storage account create --resource-group az204-blob-rg --name <myStorageAcct> --location <myLocation> --sku Standard_LRS
    ```
    
    ### Note
    Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only. Your storage account name must be unique within Azure. No two storage accounts can have the same name.
    
5. Get credentials for the storage account.
    
    - Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    - Locate the storage account created.
    - Select **Access keys** in the **Security + networking** section of the navigation pane. Here, you can view your account access keys and the complete connection string for each key.
    - Find the **Connection string** value under **key1**, and select the **Copy** button to copy the connection string. You will add the connection string value to the code in the next section.
    - In the **Blob** section of the storage account overview, select **Containers**. Leave the windows open so you can view changes made to the storage as you progress through the exercise.

## Prepare the .NET project

In this section we'll create project named _az204-blob_ and install the Azure Blob Storage client library.

1. In the VS Code terminal navigate to a directory where you want to store your project.
2. In the terminal, use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: _Program.cs_.
    
    ```Bash
    dotnet new console -n az204-blob
    ```
    
3. Use the following commands to switch to the newly created _az204-blob_ folder and build the app to verify that all is well.
	
    ```Bash
    cd az204-blob
    dotnet build
    ```
    
4. Inside the _az204-blob_ folder, create another folder named _data_. This is where the blob data files will be created and stored.
	
    ```Bash
    mkdir data
    ```
    
5. While still in the application directory, install the Azure Blob Storage client library for .NET package by using the `dotnet add package` command.
	
    ```Bash
    dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Blobs
    ```
    
    ### Tip
    Leave the console window open so you can use it to build and run the app later in the exercise.
    
6. Open the _Program.cs_ file in your editor, and replace the contents with the following code.
	
    ```C#
    using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
    using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models;
    
    Console.WriteLine("Azure Blob Storage exercise\n");
    
    // Run the examples asynchronously, wait for the results before proceeding
    ProcessAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
    
    Console.WriteLine("Press enter to exit the sample application.");
    Console.ReadLine();
    
    static async Task ProcessAsync()
    {
        // Copy the connection string from the portal in the variable below.
        string storageConnectionString = "CONNECTION STRING";
    
        // Create a client that can authenticate with a connection string
        BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(storageConnectionString);
    
        // COPY EXAMPLE CODE BELOW HERE
    
    }
    ```
    
7. Set the `storageConnectionString` variable to the value you copied from the portal.

## Build the full app

For each of the following sections below you'll find a brief description of the action being taken as well as the code snippet you'll add to the project. Each new snippet is appended to the one before it, and we'll build and run the console app at the end.

For each example below copy the code and append it to the previous snippet in the example code section of the _Program.cs_ file.

### Create a container

To create the container first create an instance of the `BlobServiceClient` class, then call the `CreateBlobContainerAsync` method to create the container in your storage account. A GUID value is appended to the container name to ensure that it is unique. The `CreateBlobContainerAsync` method will fail if the container already exists.

```C#
//Create a unique name for the container
string containerName = "wtblob" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

// Create the container and return a container client object
BlobContainerClient containerClient = await blobServiceClient.CreateBlobContainerAsync(containerName);
Console.WriteLine("A container named '" + containerName + "' has been created. " +
    "\nTake a minute and verify in the portal." + 
    "\nNext a file will be created and uploaded to the container.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

### Upload blobs to a container

The following code snippet gets a reference to a `BlobClient` object by calling the `GetBlobClient` method on the container created in the previous section. It then uploads the selected local file to the blob by calling the `UploadAsync` method. This method creates the blob if it doesn't already exist, and overwrites it if it does.

```C#
// Create a local file in the ./data/ directory for uploading and downloading
string localPath = "./data/";
string fileName = "wtfile" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".txt";
string localFilePath = Path.Combine(localPath, fileName);

// Write text to the file
await File.WriteAllTextAsync(localFilePath, "Hello, World!");

// Get a reference to the blob
BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient(fileName);

Console.WriteLine("Uploading to Blob storage as blob:\n\t {0}\n", blobClient.Uri);

// Open the file and upload its data
using (FileStream uploadFileStream = File.OpenRead(localFilePath))
    {
await blobClient.UploadAsync(uploadFileStream);
uploadFileStream.Close();
    }

Console.WriteLine("\nThe file was uploaded. We'll verify by listing" + 
        " the blobs next.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

### List the blobs in a container

List the blobs in the container by using the `GetBlobsAsync` method. In this case, only one blob has been added to the container, so the listing operation returns just that one blob.

```C#
// List blobs in the container
Console.WriteLine("Listing blobs...");
await foreach (BlobItem blobItem in containerClient.GetBlobsAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine("\t" + blobItem.Name);
}

Console.WriteLine("\nYou can also verify by looking inside the " + 
        "container in the portal." +
        "\nNext the blob will be downloaded with an altered file name.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

### Download blobs

Download the blob created previously to your local file system by using the `DownloadAsync` method. The example code adds a suffix of "DOWNLOADED" to the blob name so that you can see both files in local file system.

```C#
// Download the blob to a local file
// Append the string "DOWNLOADED" before the .txt extension 
string downloadFilePath = localFilePath.Replace(".txt", "DOWNLOADED.txt");

Console.WriteLine("\nDownloading blob to\n\t{0}\n", downloadFilePath);

// Download the blob's contents and save it to a file
BlobDownloadInfo download = await blobClient.DownloadAsync();

using (FileStream downloadFileStream = File.OpenWrite(downloadFilePath))
{
    await download.Content.CopyToAsync(downloadFileStream);
}
Console.WriteLine("\nLocate the local file in the data directory created earlier to verify it was downloaded.");
Console.WriteLine("The next step is to delete the container and local files.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

### Delete a container

The following code cleans up the resources the app created by deleting the entire container using `DeleteAsync`. It also deletes the local files created by the app.

```C#
// Delete the container and clean up local files created
Console.WriteLine("\n\nDeleting blob container...");
await containerClient.DeleteAsync();

Console.WriteLine("Deleting the local source and downloaded files...");
File.Delete(localFilePath);
File.Delete(downloadFilePath);

Console.WriteLine("Finished cleaning up.");
```

## Run the code

Now that the app is complete it's time to build and run it. Ensure you are in your application directory and run the following commands:

```Bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

There are many prompts in the app to allow you to take the time to see what's happening in the portal after each step.

## Clean up other resources

The app deleted the resources it created. You can delete all of the resources created for this exercise by using the command below. You will need to confirm that you want to delete the resources.

```Bash
az group delete --name az204-blob-rg --no-wait
```

# Manage container properties and metadata by using .NET

Blob containers support system properties and user-defined metadata, in addition to the data they contain.

- **System properties**: System properties exist on each Blob storage resource. Some of them can be read or set, while others are read-only. Under the covers, some system properties correspond to certain standard HTTP headers. The Azure Storage client library for .NET maintains these properties for you.
- **User-defined metadata**: User-defined metadata consists of one or more name-value pairs that you specify for a Blob storage resource. You can use metadata to store additional values with the resource. Metadata values are for your own purposes only, and do not affect how the resource behaves.

Metadata name/value pairs are valid HTTP headers, and so should adhere to all restrictions governing HTTP headers. Metadata names must be valid HTTP header names and valid C# identifiers, may contain only ASCII characters, and should be treated as case-insensitive. Metadata values containing non-ASCII characters should be Base64-encoded or URL-encoded.

## Retrieve container properties

To retrieve container properties, call one of the following methods of the `BlobContainerClient` class:

- `GetProperties`
- `GetPropertiesAsync`

The following code example fetches a container's system properties and writes some property values to a console window:

```C#
private static async Task ReadContainerPropertiesAsync(BlobContainerClient container)
{
    try
    {
        // Fetch some container properties and write out their values.
        var properties = await container.GetPropertiesAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"Properties for container {container.Uri}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Public access level: {properties.Value.PublicAccess}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Last modified time in UTC: {properties.Value.LastModified}");
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"HTTP error code {e.Status}: {e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

## Set and retrieve metadata

You can specify metadata as one or more name-value pairs on a blob or container resource. To set metadata, add name-value pairs to an `IDictionary` object, and then call one of the following methods of the `BlobContainerClient` class to write the values:

- `SetMetadata`
- `SetMetadataAsync`

The name of your metadata must conform to the naming conventions for C# identifiers. Metadata names preserve the case with which they were created, but are case-insensitive when set or read. If two or more metadata headers with the same name are submitted for a resource, Blob storage comma-separates and concatenates the two values and returns HTTP response code `200 (OK)`.

The following code example sets metadata on a container.

```C#
public static async Task AddContainerMetadataAsync(BlobContainerClient container)
{
    try
    {
        IDictionary<string, string> metadata =
           new Dictionary<string, string>();

        // Add some metadata to the container.
        metadata.Add("docType", "textDocuments");
        metadata.Add("category", "guidance");

        // Set the container's metadata.
        await container.SetMetadataAsync(metadata);
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"HTTP error code {e.Status}: {e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

The `GetProperties` and `GetPropertiesAsync` methods are used to retrieve metadata in addition to properties as shown earlier.

The following code example retrieves metadata from a container.

```C#
public static async Task ReadContainerMetadataAsync(BlobContainerClient container)
{
    try
    {
        var properties = await container.GetPropertiesAsync();

        // Enumerate the container's metadata.
        Console.WriteLine("Container metadata:");
        foreach (var metadataItem in properties.Value.Metadata)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"\tKey: {metadataItem.Key}");
            Console.WriteLine($"\tValue: {metadataItem.Value}");
        }
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"HTTP error code {e.Status}: {e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

# Set and retrieve properties and metadata for blob resources by using REST

Containers and blobs support custom metadata, represented as HTTP headers. Metadata headers can be set on a request that creates a new container or blob resource, or on a request that explicitly creates a property on an existing resource.

## Metadata header format

Metadata headers are name/value pairs. The format for the header is:

```
x-ms-meta-name:string-value  
```

Beginning with version 2009-09-19, metadata names must adhere to the naming rules for C# identifiers.

Names are case-insensitive. Note that metadata names preserve the case with which they were created, but are case-insensitive when set or read. If two or more metadata headers with the same name are submitted for a resource, the Blob service returns status code `400 (Bad Request)`.

The metadata consists of name/value pairs. The total size of all metadata pairs can be up to 8KB in size.

Metadata name/value pairs are valid HTTP headers, and so they adhere to all restrictions governing HTTP headers.

## Operations on metadata

Metadata on a blob or container resource can be retrieved or set directly, without returning or altering the content of the resource.

Note that metadata values can only be read or written in full; partial updates are not supported. Setting metadata on a resource overwrites any existing metadata values for that resource.

### Retrieving properties and metadata

The GET and HEAD operations both retrieve metadata headers for the specified container or blob. These operations return headers only; they do not return a response body. The URI syntax for retrieving metadata headers on a container is as follows:

```http
GET/HEAD https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?restype=container
```

The URI syntax for retrieving metadata headers on a blob is as follows:

```http
GET/HEAD https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=metadata
```

### Setting Metadata Headers

The PUT operation sets metadata headers on the specified container or blob, overwriting any existing metadata on the resource. Calling PUT without any headers on the request clears all existing metadata on the resource.

The URI syntax for setting metadata headers on a container is as follows:

```http
PUT https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?comp=metadata&restype=container
```

The URI syntax for setting metadata headers on a blob is as follows:

```http
PUT https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=metadata
```

## Standard HTTP properties for containers and blobs

Containers and blobs also support certain standard HTTP properties. Properties and metadata are both represented as standard HTTP headers; the difference between them is in the naming of the headers. Metadata headers are named with the header prefix `x-ms-meta-` and a custom name. Property headers use standard HTTP header names, as specified in the Header Field Definitions section 14 of the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification.

The standard HTTP headers supported on containers include:

- `ETag`
- `Last-Modified`

The standard HTTP headers supported on blobs include:

- `ETag`
- `Last-Modified`
- `Content-Length`
- `Content-Type`
- `Content-MD5`
- `Content-Encoding`
- `Content-Language`
- `Cache-Control`
- `Origin`
- `Range`
