Present perfect question word questions are made from **question word +** **have/has + subject + past participle?**

#### **Ever** and **never** 
We often use the present perfect with the words **ever** or **never**. **Ever** mean **at any time in someone's life**. We usually use **ever** in questions.

*'**Has he ever worked** in China?' 'No, **he hasn't**.'*

***Never** means **not at any time in someone's life.***

***I've never seen** the first Bond film.*

Sometimes we ask questions with **never**. Often we do this to express surprise:

***Have you never eaten a banana?*** 

#### Past participles  
The **past participle** is the third form of the verb. For example, with the verb **to see**, the three forms are: **see, saw, seen.**

We use the past participle in present perfect sentences with **ever** and **never.**

***Have you ever eaten** sushi?*

***I've never seen** the first Bond film.*
