## Will, going to, be likely to and might

### Form - will and might

For **will** and **might**, the form is **subject + will / might + infinitive**.

We use the same form for all persons (I, you, he, she, and so on). You can contract **will** to **'ll** in the positive form - we normally do this in spoken language.
#### Positive

- _**The new smartphone will have** all sorts of special features._
- _**We'll be connected** 24/7 when everywhere has free wifi._
- _I've ordered a new phone for the office. **It might arrive** today._
#### Negative

- _**This video call will not last long** - we only have one thing to discuss._
- _**We won't see** much change in keyboard layouts for the next few years._
- _**There might not be** any announcements about the new technology room today - don't count on it!_

We can use the contracted form **won't** for all persons (I, you, he, she, and so on). Sometimes we contract **might not** to **mightn't**, especially in speaking.

### Form - going to and be likely to

For **going to** and **likely to**, the form is **subject + am/are/is + going to/likely to + infinitive**. We can contract **I am** (I'm), **you are/we are/they are** (you're/we're/they're) and **he is/she is** (he's/she's).

#### Positive

- _**They're going to announce** a new line of laptops soon._
- _**The line is going to come out** in September._ _**It's going to be** all over the news._
- _**It's likely to be** a major advance in computing technology._
#### Negative

- _Some people say **technology isn't going to change** our lives that much._
- _**We aren't going to see** the smartring any time soon._

The negative of **likely** is **unlikely**.

- _**The new smartwatches are unlikely** to be a big revolution in technology._
#### Questions

To form questions with **will**, **going** **to** and **likely**, it's **auxiliary** (Will/Am/Is/Are) **+ subject + verb**. We often use short answers.

- _**Will this new smartwatch change** my life? No, it **won't**._
- _**Are they going to announce** the software release today? Yes, they **are**._
- _**Is it likely to be** any better than the previous version? No, it **isn't**._

We can also make questions with question words.

- _**When will they sort out** the computers at work?_
- _**Who will win** the tech race?_
- _**Where are they going to release** the new phone first?_

It is possible to ask a question with **Might + subject + infinitive**, but it's more common to form a question with **Do you think + subject + might + infinitive**.

- _**Do you think this might change** computing as we know it?_

### Important note: Will and might

Remember that **will** and **might** are modal verbs, so we use the infinitive without **to** after them.

**WRONG:**

- _People **will to go** on holiday to the moon within 50 years._
- _They **might to make** a computer that is really small._

**CORRECT:**

- _People **will go** on holiday to the moon within 50 years._
- _They **might make** a computer that is really small._
