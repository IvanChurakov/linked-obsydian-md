### Life experiences

When talking about a life experience, we can use the **present perfect**. We don't say when it happened because we're more interested in the experience, than the time or date.

- _My wife **has seen** both Sex and the City movies._

If we want to say **when** the experience happened in the past, we use the **past simple**.

- _She **watched** the newest Sex and the City movie **last**_ **week**.

We often use the **present perfect** with the words **ever** and **never**.

- _**Have you ever fallen** in love? No, sadly I'**ve never been** in love._

We can answer these questions with **Yes, I have**. or **No, I haven't**.

If we want to say how many times we have done something, we can use the **present perfect**, or we can add a **past simple** sentence with an expression of time or place.

- _'Have you ever fallen in love?' 'Yes. I've actually been in love twice.'  
- _'Have you ever fallen in love?' 'Yes, I have. I fell in love twice with different women when I was in Japan.'_

### Recent past actions that are important now

We use the **present perfect** when things that happened in the recent past are important now.

- _Oh no! I'**ve lost** my wedding ring... My wife will kill me!_

We use the **past simple** to say when the action happened.

- _I **lost** my wedding ring **last night**..._

---
### Past situations that are still happening now

We use the **present perfect** for situations that started in the past and are still happening now.

- _I haven't seen my husband this morning._ (It is still this morning.)

We use the **past simple** for situations that started and finished in the past.

- _I didn't see my husband this morning._ (It is this afternoon or evening now.)

---
### How long... questions

We sometimes use the **present perfect** in these questions.

- _**How long have you lived** with your boyfriend?_

We talk about **how long** with the words **for** (meaning throughout a period of time) and **since** (meaning from a point of time to now - this can be a date or a past simple phrase).

- _We **have** **lived** together for three years._  
- _We'**ve been** in a relationship since 2002._  
- _I'**ve known** him since we were children._

If we know it is a completed event, we can ask a **how long** question with the **past simple**.

- _'**How long did** you **live** with your **ex-husband**?' 'We **lived** together for about six years. I moved out when I found out he was cheating!'_

### With just, already and yet

We use the **present perfect** with **just**, **already** and **yet** to talk about recent events in the past. The exact time is not important. We use **just** and **already** mostly in positive sentences. We use **yet** in negative sentences and questions.

- _I'_**_ve just met** the most gorgeous man! I wonder if he's single...  
- _'Let's go to the movies tonight, James.' 'We'**ve already been** three times this week. I think your movie mad, Jane!'_
- _He **hasn't asked me out yet**._
- _**Have** you **decided** when to have your wedding **yet**?_

---
### Completed actions in the past

We usually talk about these actions and events using the **past simple**. We often include a time reference in these sentences.

- _I **met** my wife **on 3 July 1990** and we **got** married **in August**.  
- _We **went** on holiday three times together **in 1997.**_
- _We **celebrated** our 14th anniversary **last August**._
- _Our close friends **moved** to France **three months ago**._

### Form

#### Present perfect

- _We **have lived** together for six years._

The **present perfect** is made of two parts: the **present form of the verb have** and the **past participle of the main verb**.

Here is how it works in positive, negative and question forms.
##### Positive

**subject + have + past participle**

- _**I have lived** here for two years. **I've lived** here for two years._
- _**We have lived** together for one year. **We've lived** together for one year._
- _**You have started** dating that guy. **You've started** dating that guy._
- _**They have been** together much longer. **They've been** together much longer._

- _**He has started** seeing that girl. **He's started** seeing that girl._
- _**She has forgiven** him again. **She's forgiven** him again._
##### Negative

**subject + haven't/hasn't + past participle**

- _**I haven't been** in a relationship for years._
- _**We haven't lived** together very long._
- _**You haven't moved** in together yet._
- _**They haven't been** on holiday together._

- _**He hasn't dated** anyone else._
- _**She hasn't been** married before._
- _**It hasn't been** a great time for them._
##### Questions

**Have/Has + subject + past participle**

- _**Have you asked** her out?  
- _**Have they started** dating?  
- _**Have we been** married twenty-five years already?

- _**Has** **he** really **dated** her sister as well?  
- _**Has she seen** anyone else lately?  
- _**Has it been** long since you called her?

#### Past simple

With the past simple the form doesn't change for each person (I/you/he/she/it/we/they). Remember the regular verbs end **-ed** but irregular verbs don't follow this riule and have their own form.

##### Positive

- _**I met** my wife in France.  
- _**You arrived** early.  
- _**He dated** three women before meeting his wife.  
- _**She thought** he was the one.  
- _**It seemed** like a perfect relationship.  
- _**We wanted** to go to the movies together.  
- _**They organised** a special holiday for their anniversary._
##### Negative

**subject + did not / didn't + verb**

- _**I did not / didn't meet** her in Spain.  
- _**You did not /didn't see** him again.  
- _**He did not / didn't get** anything for their anniversary.  
- _**She did not / didn't tell** him about her problem.  
- _**It did not / didn't end** well.  
- _**We did not / didn't want** to move in with his parents.
- _**They did not / didn't want** a flashy wedding ceremony._
##### Questions

**Did + subject + verb**

- _**Did you ask** him out then?  
- _**Did he propose** on holiday?  
- _**Did she like** her ring?  
- _**Did we book** that band for the wedding reception?  
- _**Did they** really **run** away together?

### Take note: time expressions

We use the past simple, but not the present perfect, with past time expressions like **yesterday**, **last month**, **six years ago**, **when I was a child.**

**CORRECT:** _What **did you do** **when** **you finished college**_?

**WRONG:** _What **have you done** **when** **you finished college**_?


**CORRECT:** _I **left** that company **three years** **ago**_.

**WRONG:** _I **have** **left** that company **three years** **ago**_.

### Take note: writing and speech

We often use the past simple (not the present perfect) to describe events in stories, when one thing happens after another in the past. We use the present perfect more in speech than in writing.

---
### Spoken English

In everyday speech and writing, it’s common to use a contraction with the auxiliary verb in the present perfect and the past simple.

- **_I’ve_** _just been to the supermarket._
- **_We haven’t_** _ever tried eating snails._
- _He **didn’t** answer his phone when I called_.
