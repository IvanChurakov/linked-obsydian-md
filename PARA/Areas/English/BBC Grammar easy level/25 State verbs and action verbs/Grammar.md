### Informal English

In **very informal English**, the continuous form is sometimes used with state verbs. An example is the restaurant advertisement that says, ‘**I’m loving it!**’ You might also hear someone say, ‘**I’m hating this movie.**’ The **-ing** form of the verbs in these examples have a sense of being temporary.

- *(Right now) I’**m hating** this movie.*  
- *(General opinion) I **like** the move I saw last week.*
