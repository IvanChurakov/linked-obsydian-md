### Meaning and use

The word **like** can be used in a number of different ways. In this unit we look at two of these:

**1. Like** can be used as a **verb** to express a preference or interest in a person, place or thing.

- _I like your earrings. Where did you get them?_

**2. Like** can also be used as a **preposition** to ask for a description of a person, place or thing.

_Emily: What’s your English teacher **like**?_

_Bob: She’s kind and intelligent._

### Form (as verb)

### Take note: Is the question asking for preference or description?

When asking for preference, we use **like** with **do** or **does** in the question.

- **_Do_** _you **like** playing tennis?_
- _What sports **do** you **like**?_ 

We don’t use **do** or **does** when asking for a description. Instead, we start the question with **what** and end with **like**.

- **_What_** _is she **like**?_
- **_What_**_’s London **like**?_
- **_What_** _was your weekend **like**?_

---
### Take note: Time and place

We can specify time and place when asking for a description by using a phrase at the end of the question.

- _What will the weather be like **next weekend**?_
- _What are the beaches like **in Barcelona**?_

---
### Spoken English

In formal speech (or writing), each word in a question usually appears separately.

- **_What is_** _your new house like?_

However, we usually use contractions in informal speech (and writing).

- **_What’s_** _your new house like?_
