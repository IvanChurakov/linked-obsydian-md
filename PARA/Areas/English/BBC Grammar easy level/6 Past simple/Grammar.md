### Past simple - Meaning and use

We use the past simple when an action or situation happens and finishes in the past. We usually say or know when it happened.

- *She **called** me at the office yesterday.*
- *I **worked** in London in 2010.*
- *Steve **went** to the US three times last year.*

We often use the past simple in stories, when one thing happens after another in the past.

- *I **stopped** working in London and I **looked** for another job.*

### Past simple positive

For regular verbs, the past simple ends in **-ed**. Irregular verbs have a different past form. The past simple form is the same for all persons (_I, you, he, she,_ etc.)

- *I **finished** university in 2010 and I **started** a job in a bank.*
- *Then he **left** that job and **went** to live in Japan.*
- *We **lived** there for a year.*

### Past simple negative

We make the negative form with **didn’t (did not)** **+** **infinitive without ‘to’**.

- *I **didn’t like** working in a bank.*
- *He **didn’t go** to the US. He went to Japan.*

### Past simple questions

Past simple wh-word questions are made from **question word + did + subject + infinitive.**

- ***Where did you go** last night?*

The question word **how** is usually combined with other words when asking for information, such as **size**, **time**, or the **price** of something.

- ***How long did it take** to cook dinner?*

Past simple yes/no questions are made from **did** **+** **subject** **+** **infinitive without ‘to’**.

- ***Did** **you like** living in Japan?*
- *What **did your children do** there?*

We can use short answers:

- *Did you go to Anjali’s party last night? **Yes**, **I did.** **/** **No, I didn’t***.

### Take note: spelling changes

Some regular verbs end in **-ed,** but have some spelling changes in the past simple.

stop – stop**ped  
**travel – travel**led  
**marry – marr**ied  
study - stud**ied**

### Take note: time expressions

We often use the past simple with time expressions like **yesterday**, **last month**, **six years ago**, **when I was a child**.

- *Did you travel a lot **when you were young**?*
- *He married Sonya **three years ago**.*
