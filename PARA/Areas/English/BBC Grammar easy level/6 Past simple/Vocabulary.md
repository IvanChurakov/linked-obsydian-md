### -ing and –ed adjectives

The main difference is that –ing adjectives are usually used to talk about the **person, place or thing** that is making us feel a certain way:

Yawn! **This lecture is really boring**!

But –ed adjectives are used to talk about how **we** feel:

I’ve been listening to him for hours – **I’m so bored**.

**Be careful:** If you say I am boring – it’s grammatically correct, but it means that you make other people feel bored!
