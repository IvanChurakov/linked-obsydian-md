### Meaning and use

We can use **used to** and **would** to talk about things we did regularly in the past, but we don’t do now. We use **used to** for either habits or states in the past. **Would** is used only for past habits, not for past states.

- _Elena **used to** visit her grandson on Saturdays, but now she visits him on Sundays. (past habit)_
- _On Fridays, we **would** take a long walk after lunch. (past habit)_
- _The weather **didn’t use to** be so cold in May. (past state)_

**NOT:** The weather **wouldn’t** be so cold in May.

**Used to** and **would** often have the idea of comparison or change over time.
