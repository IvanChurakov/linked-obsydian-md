### Mixed tenses
#### Present simple and present continuous:

We use the **present continuous** for things that are happening now and for temporary situations. We often use time expressions like _at the moment, this week, these days_.

- **_We're staying_** _in a fantastic hotel in Goa **this week**._
- _What **are you doing** **these days**?_
- _I hope **you aren't working** too hard._

We use the **present simple** for things that we do regularly and for permanent situations. We often use adverbs of frequency and time expressions like _every day, on Saturdays_.

- **_I swim_** _**every day** before breakfast_.
- **_Jake doesn't get up_** _that early though._
- **_It usually begins_** _around June._

#### Past simple and present perfect:

We use the **past simple** tense when an action or situation happens and finishes in the past. We usually say or know when it happens.

- **_We arrived_** _**two days ago**._
- **_I didn't realise_** _before that it usually begins around June._
- **_Did you manage_** _to book that hotel while there was a cheap offer?_ 

We use the **present perfect** in several ways.

1) to talk about our experiences in the past. We don't say when these happened because we are interested in the experience, not the time or date. We often use the words **ever** and **never**. 

- **_Have you ever been_** _here?_
- **_I've never been_** _to Goa._

2) to talk about situations that started in the past and are continuing now. We sometimes ask a question with **how long + the present perfect** and we answer it with the words **for** or **since**.

- **_How long has Mia been_** _in Goa?_
- **_She's been_** _there **for** two days. / **She's been** there **since** Wednesday._
- **_It's been_** _really hot **since** then._

3) to say whether an action has happened or not at the present time. The words **just**, **already** and **yet** are very common with this use of the present perfect.

- **_I've already done_** _some sunbathing. ­_
- **_We haven't seen_** _much yet._
- **_The sun's just_** _disappeared!_

#### Present continuous and _be going to_ for future

We use the present continuous to talk about the future when we have made an arrangement to do something. Perhaps we have already booked tickets for something.

- _We’re coming home next Wednesday._

We use be going to + infinitive for future plans.

- _We’re going to visit the Saturday Night Market tomorrow._  
- _Are you going to go to Egypt in September?_

We also use _be going to_ for something that we expect to happen because we know that it is very likely. We can’t use the present continuous in this way.

- _They say that the rainy season is going to start soon._
