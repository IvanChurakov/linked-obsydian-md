### 6 Minute Vocabulary**

#### Vocabulary points to take away

For verbs ending in a consonant, vowel, consonant like **get** and be**gin** double the final consonant before **–ing** and **–ed**:

_I’ve **stopped** si**tting** in the sun because it’s begi**nning** to get too hot._

BUT If the final syllable of the verb is not stressed, don’t double the consonant:

_They’ve been liste**ning** to what’s happe**ned** on the news._

When there is a short vowel sound before a consonant, we often double the consonant:

_He sent me a_ **message** asking me to **collect** him at the station.

BUT this is only a general guide, so you need a technique for learning how to spell these words:

_**C**heerful **C**harlie and **M**ad **M**ary share a**cc**o**mm**odation._
