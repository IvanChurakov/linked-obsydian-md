### Meaning and use

In English, we can talk about the present and past in both the **active voice** and **passive voice**.The **active voice** focuses on the **agent** or **person or thing doing** the action.

- **_Alice_** _sent Mary a birthday card._
- **_Many people_** _listen to pop music._

The **passive voice** focuses on the **receiver** of the action.

- **_Mary_** _was sent a birthday card by Alice._
- **_Pop music_** _is listened to by many people._

We use the passive for a number of reasons. We may be **more interested in the action** than the person or thing (agent) performing the action. In this case, it may be **left out completely**.

- _First, the onion **was washed** and then **sliced**._
- _Next, it **was fried** and **mixed** with red peppers._
- _Finally, it **was added** to the beef and **cooked** for fifteen minutes._

We may also leave the agent out if it is **unimportant**, **unknown** or **obvious** to the listener.

- _The bank robbers were arrested._
- _David’s bike was stolen last week._
- _No survivors were discovered at the crash site._

### Form

The **passive** is made with **subject + to be + past participle**. Note that the active voice object becomes the passive voice subject. The verb **to be** is used to express both **present tense** and **past tense**.

#### Positive

- **_Millions of photographs are taken_** _every day._
- **_The internet is used_** _by people all over the world._
- **_My sister was bitten_** _by a dog._

#### Negative

- **_Japanese isn’t widely spoken_** _outside Japan._
- **_We weren’t seated_** _until well after nine o’clock._
- **_Our new washing machine wasn’t delivered_** _on time._

#### Question

- **_Were you given_** _a name tag when you arrived?_
- **_Is your form filled out_** _correctly?_
- **_Are these fish caught_** _locally?_

### Take note: identifying the passive

Unlike in the active voice, the main verb in the passive is **always the past participle**.

In the passive, the agent or doer of a verb is always introduced with **by**.

---
### Take note: past participle as adjective

In passive sentences, the past participle sometimes acts as an adjective.

- _The restaurant was **closed** all day._

### Spoken English

While the passive is commonly used in formal or academic written English, it is more common to hear the active voice in spoken English.
