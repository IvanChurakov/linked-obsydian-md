We use the **second conditional** in English when we want to talk about **unreal** situations or **things we don’t think will happen**. We use it to talk about the **possible results** of these situations. It is made like this:

**if + past simple, … would + infinitive**

Here are some examples:

- _If we all recycled more, there would be a lot less waste in the world._
- _If I lived by the sea, I’d go swimming every day._

A conditional sentence has **two parts**. The **if** part tells us about the **unreal** or **unlikely situation**. The **would** part tells us the **possible results** of this situation.

- _If I lived by the sea, … (This is the imaginary situation.)_  
- _… I’d go swimming every day. (This is the result of the imaginary situation.)_

The two parts can come in any order. When the **if** part comes first in the sentence, we put a comma between the **if** part and the **would** part. You don’t use a comma when the **would** part comes first.

- _If I had more free time, I would be more relaxed._  
- _I would be more relaxed if I had more free time._

We use the **past simple** in the if part – but **second conditional** sentences aren’t about the past. We use the **past form** to show that the situation isn’t real. The **would** part tells us the result of this imaginary situation.

We sometimes use **were** instead of **was** in the **if** part of a second conditional sentence. It means the same, but when we use **were**, the sentence sounds more **formal**.

- _If it were time to leave, I’d go._  
- _We’d have lunch outside if it weren’t raining._
