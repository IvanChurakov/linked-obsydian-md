### Meaning and use

Defining relative clauses give us important information about the **person**, **thing** or **place** that we are talking about. When making a relative clause, we can use the following relative pronouns: **who** for people, **that** and **which** for things, and **where** for places.

- _The police officer arrested the man **who robbed the bank**._

In this example, **‘who robbed the bank’** tells us which man the police officer arrested. Without this information, we do not know which man was arrested.

- _David visited the place **where we first met**._

Again, **‘where we first met’** tells us which place David visited.

- _These are the shoes **that I bought in Tokyo**._
- _Summer is the season **which I enjoy the most**._

**‘That I bought in Tokyo’** adds information about the shoes, and **‘which I enjoy the most’** adds information about the season.

### Form

A defining relative clause is made with **noun + relative pronoun + rest of clause**.

#### Positive

- _My father is **the man who owns this restaurant**._
- **_The restaurant where we met_** _closed down last year._

#### Negative

- _This isn’t **the sandwich that I ordered**._
- _David didn’t recognise **the woman who waved at him**._  

#### Question

- _Are you **the person who called earlier**?_
- _Is this **the cafe where you left your handbag**?_

### Take note: using ‘whom’ instead of ‘who’

In **formal** speech and written English, **whom** replaces **who** when the relative pronoun refers to the **object** of the relative clause.

- _The person **who called me** was my father._ (who = subject)
- _The person **whom I called** was my father._ (who = object)

### Spoken English

In **informal** speech, the pronoun **that** can replace **who**, **which** and **where**.

- _Jennifer is the woman **that** I love._
- _The library is the place **that** I feel the most relaxed._

If the relative pronoun functions as the **object** of the relative clause, the relative pronoun can be left out completely.

- _Kelly is the woman **whom** I love. = Kelly is the woman I love._
- _This is the bag **that** I bought. = This is the bag I bought._

However, if the relative pronoun is the **subject** of the relative clause, it cannot be left out. Here, **who** refers to the **subject**.

- _He’s the man. He found my wallet._
- _He’s the man **who** found my wallet._

Therefore, the following sentence is **incorrect**:

- _He’s the man found my wallet._
