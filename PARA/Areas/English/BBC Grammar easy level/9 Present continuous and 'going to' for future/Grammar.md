### Meaning and use

We can use the **present continuous** to talk about the future when we have already arranged to do something. It's definite, not just an idea. Perhaps we have put the arrangement in our diaries.

- _'Are you free at 2 o'clock on Tuesday?'  'No, **I'm meeting** a client.'_

We can use **be going to** to talk about something that we have decided to do in the future, but not arranged yet. It's possible that the plan might change.

- _When I finish at college, **I'm going to** spend a year travelling._

The uses of the present continuous and 'be going to' with future meaning are very similar and it is often possible to use either of them, with little or no change in meaning.

We also use **be going to** for something that we expect to happen because we can see from the present situation that it is very likely. We can't use the present continuous in this way.

- _It's so cold. I'm sure **it's going to** snow soon._
- _Oh no! That **car's going to** hit the tree._

### Take note: time expressions

For both the present continuous for arrangements and 'be going to' for plans, we often use time expressions like **at half-past ten, next Thursday, at the weekend, soon**.

- _Are you coming_ _home **soon**?_
- _I'm going to_ _send out all the invitations **next week.**_

### Take note: arrangements and timetables

Use the present continuous and NOT the present simple for things that you have arranged to do. Use the present simple for future events on timetables and programmes.

- **_We're going_** _by train tomorrow morning._
- **_The train leaves_** _at 7.45._

### Spoken English

We often pronounce **going to** as ‘**gonna**’, especially in informal conversation.
