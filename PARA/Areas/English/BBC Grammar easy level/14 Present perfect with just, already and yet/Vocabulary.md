### 6 Minute Vocabulary

**Compound nouns** are nouns that are made up of a combination of two (or sometimes more) nouns or a combination of a noun and a prepositional phrase. Some examples of these are:

- popcorn
- keyboard
- hot dog
- ice cream
- daughter-in-law
- father-in-law

There are three ways that compound nouns can be written: with the two nouns making up the compound noun placed together **without a space** between them, with the two nouns **separated by a space**, and with the words **connected by hyphens** (a hyphen is this punctuation mark **-** )

There are no rules for the first two ways of writing compound nouns (with or without a space between the two nouns), so it is a good idea to check in a good dictionary. You can also check whether you can write plural forms of these compound nouns (e.g. **keyboards**)

---
#### Form

Without a space:

- pop + corn = popcorn
- key + board = keyboard
- post + card = postcard

With a space:

- hot + dog = hot dog
- ice + cream = ice cream
- alarm + clock = alarm clock

The third way of writing compounds here is a combination of a **noun** (daughter) and a **prepositional phrase** (-in-law). When we write these the form is:

- daughter + -in-law = daughter-in-law
- father + -in-law = father-in-law

#### Pronunciation

We pronounce most compound nouns, especially those made up of two nouns, with the **stress on the first syllable**. This is important as it can change the meaning.

**hot dog** (the same stress on each word) = a dog that is hot

**hot** dog (more stress on the first word) = a snack made from a bread bun and a sausage
