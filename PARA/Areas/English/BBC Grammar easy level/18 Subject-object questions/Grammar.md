### Meaning and use

A simple way of asking questions in English is by using **interrogatives**, or **question words**, such as **who** or **what**. These questions are called **wh-questions** and are used when asking for information. 

- _What time is it?_
- _Who ate the biscuits?_

Look at this sentence:

- _Sally met David Beckham._

We can ask about the **subject** or **object** of this sentence:

- **Asking about the subject: _Who_** _met David Beckham? **Sally** met David Beckham._
- **Asking about the object: _Who_** _did Sally meet? Sally met **David Beckham**._

The first question is a **subject question** because **who** refers to the **subject**. There is no auxiliary. The second question is an **object question** because **who** refers to the **object** and comes before the auxiliary **did**.

### Form

Subject questionswith no auxiliary are formed with: **question word + verb + object**, where the verb agrees with the subject.

- ‘***Who speaks Japanese?***’ ‘***Kento** speaks Japanese.*’
- ‘***Who rang the doorbell?***’ ‘***The milkman** rang the doorbell.*’
- ‘***What caused the accident?***’ ‘***Bad weather** caused the accident.*’

**Whose** and **which** ask about **possession** and **choice**,and can be used in subject questions like this:

- **_Whose horse_** _finished the race first?_
- ***Which painting** cost the most?*

### Take note: using ‘what’ or ‘which’

As well as **which**, **what** is also used to ask about **choices**. If the choice is limited, we use **which** and this is usually followed by a noun.

- **_What social networks_** _do you use?_
- **_What_** _happened to your shirt?_
- **_Which chair_** _is yours?_
- **_Which of these restaurants_** _has the best service?_**_Which hand_** _do you write with?_

### Spoken English

In casual speech, **who is** or **who has** often becomes **who's**. This can cause problems for the listener because it sounds the same as the question word **whose**, which is used to show **possession**. **Whose** usually comes before a **noun**.

- **_Who’s_** _coming for dinner?_**_Whose bike_** _got stolen?_**_Whose hat_** _cost over £100?_
- **_Whose mobile phone_** _still has a signal?_
