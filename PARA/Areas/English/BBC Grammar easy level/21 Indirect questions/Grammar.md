### Meaning and use

There are two ways to ask questions in English – directly and indirectly. Both have the same meaning, but we use **indirect questions** if we want to sound more formal or polite, especially when we are talking to people we don’t know.

- (direct question) _What time is it?_
- (indirect question) _Could you tell me what time it is?_

When we create indirect questions, the thing we are asking about becomes part of a longer question. And we use introductory phrases such as:

- _Can/could you tell/show me …?_
- _Do you know …?_
- _Would you mind telling/showing me …?_
- _Have you any idea …?_
- _I wonder …_
- _I wonder if you would mind telling/showing me …?_

This is followed by either a question word, such as **what, who, when, where,** **how,** or by **if/whether**, and then the information we want to know. The word order changes from the order of a direct question. Indirect questions have the same word order as statements.

- (direct question) _Where is the photocopier?_
- (indirect question) _Do you know where the photocopier is?_

If we are making an indirect question from a direct question which already contains a question word, like **what, who, when, where or how**, we keep that same question word.

- (Direct question) - **_What_** _is the dress code in the office?_
- (Indirect question) - _Could you tell me **what** the dress code is in the office?_

### Form

Indirect questions have the same word order as statements:

**introductory phrase + if or whether/question word + subject + verb**

Look at the following:

- _(statement) - The meeting is at two._
- _(direct question) - When is the meeting?_
- **_(indirect question) -_** _**Do you know when the meeting is?**_
- **_(indirect question) - Do you know if the meeting is at two?_**

Notice that the subject and verb in indirect questions after the question word **when** or **if/whether** are in the same order as in statements, i.e. **subject + verb**

- _(subject) (verb)_
- **_The meeting_** **_is …_**
- **_… the meeting is_**

In the direct question, however, the order is: **verb + subject** after the question word.

- _When_ **_is_ _the meeting ?_**

### Take note: _do, does_ and _did_ 

In the present and past simple, we use **do/does** or **did** to make direct questions. When we make indirect questions in the present and past simple, we don’t use these auxiliaries. 

- (direct question) - What time **does** the meeting **start**?
- (indirect question) - Can you tell me what time the meeting **starts**?

- (direct question) - Why **did** you **leave** your last job?
- (indirect question) - Can you tell me why you **left** your last job?        

- (direct question) - **Did** Mr Yenko **ring** yesterday?
- (indirect question) - Do you know if Mr Yenko **rang** yesterday?
