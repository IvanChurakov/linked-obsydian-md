### A and an

**A** or **an** means one person or thing. We use **a** or **an**: 

1) before singular nouns: _I've been to **a concert**._ _We had **a great day** and we saw **an elephant**_. 

2) before the name of a job: _My sister wants to be **an engineer**_.

### A or an?

Use **a** before consonant sounds: **_a ch_**_air,_ **_a h_**_orse,_ **_a l_**_aptop_

This includes letters **u** or **eu** when they are pronounced **y** (**/j/**): **a u**niversity, **a e**uro

Use **an** before vowel sounds. These words usually start with **a, e, i, o, u**: **_an a_**_rchitect,_ **_an i_**_dea,_ **_an u_**_mbrella_

Also use **an** with words that start with the letter h when the h is not pronounced: **_an h_**_our,_ **_an h_**_onour_

### The

We use **the**: 

1) before singular nouns that we have already mentioned with **a/an**: 

_We saw **an elephant. The elephant** was standing under some trees._ 


2) before singular, plural or uncountable nouns when we say exactly which person or thing we mean: 

**_The people_** _**who live next door** are really nice._

_Where's **the brown sugar**?_ 

Note that we don't use **the** before plural and uncountable nouns when we are talking about things in general:

**_Children_** _need plenty of exercise and fresh air._ (children in general) 

**_Sugar_** _isn't good for you._ (sugar in general)


3) We also use **the** before singular, plural or uncountable nouns when it is clear which person or thing we mean:

_I'm going to **the supermarket**._ (the one we always go to) 

**_The children_** _are upstairs._ (our children) 

_Could you shut **the door**?_ (the door of this room) 


4) We use **the** before nouns when there is only one:

**_The sun_** _is shining and there aren't any clouds in **the sky**_. 


5) We use **the** with superlatives:

_You're **the best dad** ever!_


6) We use **the** in many expressions with '**of**' 

_In **the** middle of the night_

_**The** Kingdom of Saudi Arabia_

_At **the** end of my holiday_

### Take note: school/university, etc.

There is a special rule for these places: school, university, college, hospital, prison, church. Compare these examples:

_The children go **to school** by bus.             I go **to the school** to help twice a week._

_Ben's studying maths **at university**.       He works in the canteen **at the university**._

_She was **in hospital** for three weeks.       Is there a shop **in the hospital**?_ 

If someone is at the place because they are a student / are sick / a prisoner, etc, we don't use **the**. If they are there for another reason, or we are talking about the building, we use **the**.

### Articles and adjectives

Adjectives go between articles and nouns: 

*What **a great place** this is!*

*I went on **an amazing trip**.*

*We went to **the famous Bondi beach**.*

---
### Pronouncing articles

We usually pronounce **a/an** with a weak vowel sound **/ə/** ('uh'). It sounds like the vowel sound in **fun**, and not the vowel sound in **cat**.

Before consonants and the letters **u** or **eu** when they are pronounced **y** (**/j/**), we pronounce **the** with this weak sound **/ə/**, too.

**_the d_**_octor, **the p**arty, **the u**niform_ 

But when **the** is before a vowel sound, we pronounce **the** with the long **ee** sound in **see**. 

**_the_** _**a**fternoon, **the** **i**ce, **the** **o**pen door, **the u**pstairs rooms_
