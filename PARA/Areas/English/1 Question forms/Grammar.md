### Meaning and Use

In English, there are two basic types of question.

1. **Yes/no questions** often begin with the verb **to be**, but can also begin with other **auxiliary verbs**, such as **do**. We ask these when we want a **yes** or **no** answer.

_Dave: **Are** you hungry?_ 
_Mike: **Yes**, I’m starving._ 

_Sarah: **Did** you get here on time?_
_Emily: **No**, I missed the bus!_

2. **Wh-questions** start with a question word, such as **who**, **what**, **where**, **when**, **why** or **how**. We ask this type of question when we want **different kinds of information**. These questions cannot be answered with a yes or no.

_Dave: **Why** are you so hungry?  
Mike: **I didn’t eat breakfast**._

_Sarah: **When** did you get here?  
Emily: **About half an hour ago.**_

### Form

**Yes/no questions** that begin with the verb **to be** are made with **to be + subject.**

- _**Are you** playing football tomorrow?_

- _**Was the weather** nice yesterday?_

If we start with an **auxiliary verb**, the order is **auxiliary + subject + main verb**.

- **_Can Jenny speak_** _Chinese?_ **_Did you go_** _to the cinema on Saturday?_

**Wh-questions** can be used to ask about the **subject** or **object** of the verb. Compare these questions:

- **_Who loves Lucy?  
- **Who does Lucy love?_**

For **subject** questions, the order is **question word + verb + object**.

- **_Who wants ice cream_** _for dessert?_**_Who broke the mirror_** _in the dining room?_**_Who answered the phone_**_?_

The **object** question form is **question word + auxiliary + subject + verb**.

- **_What did you_** _**do** at the weekend?_**_Where does your brother_** **_work_**_?  
- **Who will you_** _**ask** for help?_

### Take Note

**Asking questions with ‘how’**

The question word how is usually combined with other words when asking for information, such as size, someone’s age, or the price of something.

- _**How big** is your apartment?_
- _**How old** are your children now?_  
- _**How much** is the black dress in the window?_

### Spoken English

In formal situations, it is common to respond to a yes/no question by **repeating the auxiliary** in a complete sentence.

_Max: **Can** you use a computer?  
__Jill: Yes, I **can**._

In casual spoken English, we **do not** need to repeat the auxiliary. Answers **do not** always contain 'yes' or 'no'.

_Peter: Do you know the way to the train station?  
William: **Not really**._

_Lucy: Shall we order sushi?  
Sally: **Absolutely**!_
