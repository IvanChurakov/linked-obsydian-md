### Meaning and use

Adverbs give us more information about a verb. Adverbs of frequency tell us **how often** an activity happens. There are many adverbs to choose from. Here are some of the most common ones, listed from most frequent to least frequent

- _I **always** walk to work.._
- _They **usually** arrive late._
- _My father **often** forgets his birthday._
- _He **sometimes** wakes up early._
- _I **rarely** drink tea in the morning._
- _You **hardly ever** say you love me._
- _Jenny **never** drinks coffee in the evening._

We can use adverbs of frequency with the verb **to be**.

- _We **are never** unhappy._
- _This time of year **is usually** the coldest._

We can use **modal verbs** with adverbs of frequency. For example, we can use the auxiliary verbs **can**, **should** and **might**, which express **ability (can)**, **obligation (should)**, and **possibility (might)**.

- _Laura **can sometimes** hold her breath for over a minute._
- _You **should always** put on suncream when it’s very sunny._
- _We **might never** see each other again._

Adverbs of frequency go before the main verb.

### Take note: negative adverbs

Negative adverbs such as **never,** **seldom**, **rarely** and **hardly ever**cannot be used in negative sentences. The following sentence is incorrect, because it has a **double negative**.

**WRONG:** _The weather **isn’t never** sunny._

**CORRECT:** _The weather **is never** sunny._

### Take note: sometimes

**Sometimes** can go before the subject, before the main verb, and after the main verb.

- _We **sometimes** go fishing._

### Take note: adverbs of frequency and the present continuous

We usually use adverbs of frequency with the present simple, but they can also be used with the present continuous. The adverb comes between the auxiliary and the main verb.

- _She_**_’s always losing_** _her phone._
- **Spoken English**

Some people pronounce the **/t/ sound** in **often**; other people pronounce often with a 'silent t'. Both are acceptable.
