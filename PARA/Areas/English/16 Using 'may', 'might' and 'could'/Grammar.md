### Meaning and use

We use **might + verb**, **may + verb** or **could + verb** to talk about the possibility of something in the present or the future, when we are making a guess about a present situation, or we aren’t sure if something will happen in the future. 

- _I **might go** to the exhibition at the Tate this afternoon_. (future)
- _He’s travelling in Eastern Europe. He **may be** in Ukraine by now_. (present)
- _We **could have** some problems later this year._ (future) 

There is almost no difference in meaning between **might**, **may** and **could**.

We use **might not/mightn’t** and **may not** to talk about negative possibility. We don’t usually use a contraction for **may not**. We cannot use **could not/couldn’t** for possibility in the same way as **might not** and **may not** (see **Take note** below).

- _We **might not move** into the new offices until the New Year_.
- _Our client **may not agree** with our suggestions_.

### Form

We use **might/may/could + infinitive without ‘to’** or **might not/mightn’t/may not + infinitive without ‘to’**. They are the same for all persons (I, you, he, she, etc.). 

#### Positive

- _They are warning that storms **could hit** most of the country later today_.
- _There **might be** some delays on the railways as a result_. 

#### Negative  
  
- _Many people **may not be able to** get to work at all._
- _It **mightn’t affect** us as badly as they say._

#### Question

It is possible to ask questions with **Might/May/Could + subject + infinitive without ‘to’**, but it is more common to form a question with **Do you think + subject + might/may/could + infinitive without ‘to’**. 

- **_Do you think he might/may/could_** **_be_** _in Ukraine by now_?
- **_Might/May/Could he be_** _in Ukraine by now_?

### Take note: couldn’t

We don’t use **couldn’t** in the same way as **might not/mightn’t/****may not**. ‘Couldn’t’ means that something is impossible. 

**WRONG**: _I think there **couldn’t be any trains** today_, _so I’m going by bus._

**CORRECT**: _I think there **mightn’t be any trains** today_, _so I’m going by bus._

### Take note: ‘might’, ‘may’ and ‘could’ for permission

**Might**, **may** and **could** for permission are different from **might**, **may** and **could** for possibility. For permission with **might**, **may** and **could**, the question form is **Might/May/Could** **I** **+** **infinitive without ‘to’**. **Might** for permission is very formal. 

- **_Could/May/Might I come_** _with you to the exhibition_?

### Spoken English

**Might**, **may** and **could** are modal verbs. When we say modal verbs, we usually say them quicklyhout emphasis. We don’t pronounce the ‘**t**’ or ‘**d**’ in **might** and **could** or the ‘t’ at the end of **mightn’t** and **couldn’t**. 

- _They **might get**_ _here late._
- _We **mightn’t watch** the whole film._
- _It **couldn’t be** Pete you saw because he’s in Greece._
