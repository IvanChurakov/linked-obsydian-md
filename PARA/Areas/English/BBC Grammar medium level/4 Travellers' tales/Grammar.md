### **Meaning and use**

A multi-word verb is a verb plus a word such as **in**, **on**, **out**, **up**, **away**, **off** and **down**. We often think of these words as prepositions, but here they behave like adverbs. The adverb sometimes extends the meaning of the verb on its own.

- It’s so annoying. Jason **keeps** phoning me all the time.
- It’s so annoying. Jason **keeps on** phoning me all the time.

Here, the phrasal verb **keeps on** means **continues**. It has the same meaning as **keeps** but is slightly stronger. Other phrasal verbs that extend the meaning of the main verb are **hurry up** and **sit down**.

Many verbs can go with different adverbs and the adverbs can completely change the meaning of the verb.

- ‘When did you **break up**?’
- ‘Oh, I **broke off** our engagement ages ago. He **broke down** when I told him.’

In this conversation, **break up** means **separate**, **broke off** means **ended** and **broke down** means **became very upset**. The meanings are different from the verb **break.**

Some phrasal verbs are intransitive (they have no object) for example: **keep on** and **hurry up**. Other phrasal verbs are transative: they can be followed by a direct object, but not an object pronoun.

- I **broke off** our engagement ages ago
- **NOT:** I broke off it.

However, you can often put an object pronoun in the middle of a phrasal verb, between the verb and the adverb.

- ‘Guess what! Rob **asked me** **out** yesterday!’

Some verbs have three parts to them, an adverb and a preposition.

- ‘Ah! I’ve seen you talking to Rob a lot recently. You seem to **get on with** him really well.’

### Form

**No object  
My car broke down.**

**No object**  
My car **broke down**.

**Noun object**  
Mark **broke out of prison**.

**Object pronoun after the verb**  
Last week Ismail **broke up with her**.

**Object pronoun in the middle**  
They were engaged, but they **broke it off**.

### Take note: phrasal verbs with direct objects

With phrasal verbs, (but not prepositional verbs), the noun object can usually go before or after the adverb.

- I **broke off** our engagement. / I **broke** our engagement **off**.

### Pronunciation

For most phrasal verbs, the main stress is on the adverb.

- When did you break **up**?’
- ‘Oh, I broke **off** our engagement ages ago. He broke **down** when I told him.’

This is the same for three-part verbs.

- I’m so **looking forward to** it!

But for prepositional verbs, the stress is often on the main verb, not on the preposition.

- I really can’t **deal** with it.
