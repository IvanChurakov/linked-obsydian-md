### Meaning and use

We use the present perfect continuous to talk about an activity that started in the past and is continuing now or has recently finished.

- **I’ve been reading** that new book you lent me… I’m really enjoying it. (= action still in progress)
- Is that Joe? **I’ve been trying** to contact you. I’ve got some bad news. (= action recently finished)

We often use it to emphasise the continuous, ongoing nature of the activity or to say how long the activity has continued.

- **She’s** already **been sleeping for two hours**.
- It’s been raining **all morning**.
- I’ve been decorating the house **this summer**.

When we use the present perfect continuous for situations that have recently finished, we often use the adverb **just**.

- 'You’ve got paint all over your T-shirt.' 'Oh, **I’ve just been painting** the living room.'

We often use **recently** and **lately** with the present perfect continuous.

- I’m really tired. **I haven’t been sleeping** well **lately**.

### Form

The present perfect continuous is made with:

**subject** + **have/has/haven’t/hasn’t + been +** **present participle of main verb.**

We put **just** and **already** between **have/has** and the **past participle.** We usually put adverbs of time and duration after the main verb.

#### Negative

- Doctor, **I’ve been feeling** dizzy and faint in the mornings.

#### Question

Present perfect continuous questions are made with:

**have/has not + subject + present participle.**

- **Have you been eating** all the biscuits? There are none left!
- What **have you been doing**? You look exhausted!

### Take note: present perfect continuous and present perfect

Some verbs are almost never used in the present perfect continuous. We use the present perfect instead. The most familiar examples of these are **be** and **know.**

WRONG: **She’s been being** here for ten minutes.

CORRECT: **She’s been** here for 10 minutes.

WRONG: **I’ve** only **been knowing** him since last week.

CORRECT: **I’ve** only **known** him since last week.

### Take note: already

It is possible to put **already** at the end of a positive sentence or question.

- He has **already** been talking for ten minutes.
- Has he **already** been talking for ten minutes?
- He has been talking for ten minutes **already**.
- Has he been talking for ten minutes **already**?

### Pronunciation

In sentences with **just** and **already**, there is usually no stress on **has/have** or on **just/already**. The stress is on the subject and the present participle.

- The chicken_ _has **already** been cooking for an hour and a half.
- I have **just** been thinking about Joe. Do you think he’s better now?

But we can put stress on **just/already** if we want to emphasise how recently or early something happened.

- The chicken must be ready by now. It’s **already** been cooking for an hour and a half.
- Oh, hi Joe. I’ve **just** been talking about you to Sophie!
