### Meaning and use

We often use the past perfect when two things in a sentence happened in the past, and we need to show which thing in the sentence happened first.

- When I arrived home, my sister **had** already **made** lunch.

Here, two things happened: **I arrived home** and **my sister made lunch**. We can use the past simple, with time expressions like **then**, to talk about the things in the order that they happened.  

- My sister **made** lunch. **Then** I **arrived** home.

We can use the past perfect next to the past simple, to show which event happened first.  

**What happened first:** my son made a cake

**What happened second:** I arrived

- When I arrived home, my son **had already made** an enormous carrot cake.

With the past perfect, we can change the order of events in the sentence, and still show what happened first.

- I woke up late because **I’d forgotten** to set my alarm clock.

But we can also use the past perfect when events in a sentence are in the order that they happened.

- I **had just taken off my coat** when the telephone rang.

The past perfect part of the sentence always shows the event that happened first.

- **We hadn’t finished** cleaning by the time the guests arrived.
- By the time the guests arrived, **we hadn’t finished** cleaning.

### Form

The past perfect is made with **subject +** **had/hadn’t +** **past** **participle**.  
  
#### Positive

- When my parents got to the station, they realised **they had left** the tickets at home.
- By the time Mark arrived at work, **the staff meeting had already started**.
- I woke up late because **I’d forgotten** to set my alarm clock.

#### Negative

- Kerry couldn’t leave work on time because **she hadn’t written** the report.
- They didn’t tellthe police about the accident **they had seen**.

#### Question

- **Had you finished** your homework before the movie started?
- **Hadn’t John told** them what he wanted?

### Take note: adverbs  
Sometimes you might need to use an adverb like **already** or **just** with the past perfect. In those cases, the adverb often goes between **had/hadn’t** and the **past participle**.

- When I arrived home, my sister had **already** made lunch.
- I had **just** taken off my coat when the telephone rang.

### Take note: time expressions  
The past perfect is often used with time expressions like **when** and **by the time.**

- **When** I arrived home, my sister had made lunch.
- **By the time** I arrived at work, the staff meeting had already started.

### Spoken English  
You might notice that sometimes the past perfect looks like this:

- I **had left** my season ticket at home.

Other times, it looks like this:

- **I’d forgotten** to set my alarm clock.

In speech and in informal writing, it’s common to use a contraction with the auxiliary verb.

- **I’d** forgotten to set my alarm clock.
- I **hadn’t** written the report.

When you listen to someone using the negative form **hadn’t**, listen carefully. It is sometimes difficult to hear the difference between **had** and **hadn’t**, but it makes a big difference in meaning!
