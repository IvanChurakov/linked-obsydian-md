## Meaning and use: all, every each

Quantifiers are words that give us information about the number or amount of something. **All, every** and **each** mean the whole number of something in a group, but there are differences in how we use them. In this unit we look at how to use them with nouns.

**All** _or_ **All the** is followed by a plural or uncountable noun. **Every** and **each** are followed by a singular noun.

- **All (the) students** have their own rooms.
- **All (the) information** is on the website.
- **Every/Each student** has their own room. (OR has **his/her** own room.)

**Every** and **each** can often be used in the same place, but we prefer **every** when we are thinking about the whole number in a group, and **each** when we are thinking about the members of the group as individuals.

- I love **every painting** by that artist.
- **Each painting** is unique.

For emphasising every single one, we must use **every**not **each**.

- You’ve eaten **every chocolate** in the box!

For only two things, we can use **each** but not **every**.

- In baseball, how many players are there in **each team**?

**All**and **each** but not **every** can be followed by _of_ and a plural noun or pronoun_._ Notice that **_each of_** with a plural noun or pronoun is followed by a singular verb.

- **All of the students have** their own rooms.
- **Each of them has** their own room.

### Take note: articles

We don’t use an article (**the, a/an**) before **every** or **each**.

### Take note: possessive and demonstrative adjectives

We don’t use **every** before possessive adjectives (**his, her,** etc) or demonstrative adjectives (**these, those**).

- Tarantino’s a brilliant director. I’ve seen **all his films**.
- **NOT:** I’ve seen every his films.

## Meaning and use of both, neither, either

We use **both (of), neither (of)** and **either (of)** to talk about two people or things. **Both** means this one AND the other. **Neither** means NOT this one AND NOT the other. **Either** means this one OR the other. **Either** is used mainly in questions and negative sentences. Here are some examples of how to use them with nouns:

- I like **both** pictures. / I like **both of** the pictures.
- **Neither** _picture is right for the room. / **Neither of** the pictures is right for the room.
- She didn’t buy **either** picture in the end. / She didn’t buy **either of** the pictures in the end.

We often use **both… and**, **neither…** **nor**,and **either… or**.

- She plays **both** the violin **and** the guitar.
- **Neither** me **nor** my brother are married.
- Should I wear **either** this shirt **or** that one?
