### **Present simple**

We use the present simple tense for things that we do regularly and for facts, habits, truths and permanent situations. We often use time expressions like **every day, once a week, on Fridays**.

- **I check** my email every day. (regular activity)  
- **Yuki works** at the bank. (permanent situation)
#### Form

**For** positive sentences, use the same form as the infinitive without 'to' for **I, you, we** and **they.** For **he, she** and **it**, add -**s** or -**es** to the infinitive. Make questions and negatives with **do / does + the infinitive without 'to'.**

- **They live** in Rome.  
- **Julian starts** work at nine o’clock and **finishes** at five.  
- **I don't eat** meat.  
- **It doesn't** usually **snow** in October.  
- **Why do you read** the news online every day?  
- **Does the supermarket sell** stamps?

### Present Continuous

We use the present continuous for things that are happening at the time we are speaking, for temporary situations, and for activities that are in progress.

- Just a minute. **I’m checking** my email. (now)  
- She usually works in London, but **she’s working** from home this week. (temporary)  
- **I’m studying Economics** (activity in progress)

We can also use the present continuous for future arrangements, usually with a time expression.

- **I'm seeing** the doctor **on Monday morning**.

#### Form

For positive sentences, the form is **subject + am/is/are + verb-ing**. Make questions and negatives with **am/are/is + not + verb-ing**.

- Can I call you back later? **We’re having** dinner right now.  
- **He isn’t answering** his mobile at the moment.  
- **What are you doing?**
- **Is it raining?**

Note: There are some verbs that we don’t usually use in the continuous form. They are often verbs of thinking and feeling, for example: **hear, see, smell, hate, know, understand, want, need**.

WRONG: Could you explain that again? I’m not understanding.  
CORRECT: Could you explain that again? **I don’t understand**.

### Present Perfect

Use the present perfect for:

1) Life experiences in the past. We don’t say when these happened: we are interested in the experience, not the time or date. We often use **ever** and **never.**

- **I’ve seen** all Tarantino’s films.  
- **Have you ever eaten** sushi? - **Yes, I have**. / **No, I haven’t**.

2) Recent past actions that are important now.

- Oh no! **I’ve left** my wallet on the bus.  
- The president **has resigned**.

3) Past situations that are still happening now. We often use **how long** with **for** (throughout a period of time) and **since** (from a point in the past until now).

- **I haven’t seen** Jenny this morning. (It is still this morning.)  
- **How long have you known** Mitya? - I’ve known him **for two years**.  
- **Jack's been** in Italy **since January**.

4) With **just, already, yet** to talk about recent events in the past. The exact time is not important. Use **just** and **already** mainly in positive sentences. Use **yet** in negatives and questions.

- **It’s just stopped** raining. Let’s go out.  
- Can you feed the cat? - **I’ve already fed** her.  
- We can still watch the film. **It hasn’t started yet**.  
- **Have you done** your English homework **yet?**

**Note:** Use the past simple for completed actions in the past.

- **I saw** Jenny yesterday.  
- **Peter moved** to Saudi Arabia in 2011.  
- **Natasha didn't want** another piece of cake.  
- **When did you see** Alex?

#### Form

**For** positive sentences, the form is **subject + have/has + past participle**. Make negatives with **not** and change the word order to make questions.

= **I've finished** the report.  
- **Jack's been** in Italy since January.  
- **We've just got back** from Germany.  
- **I haven’t seen** Jenny this morning.  
- **How long has Alex known** Mitya?
