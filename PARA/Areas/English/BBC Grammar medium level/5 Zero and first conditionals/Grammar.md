## Zero and first conditionals

### **Meaning and use**

We use the zero conditional to talk about things which always happen if a particular action takes place. These can be scientific facts, or things we believe are always true.

- **When you take** exercise, **your heart beats** faster.
- **If I drink** milk, **I get** stomach ache.

We can use **if** or **when** with the same meaning:

- **If you take** exercise, **your heart beats** faster.
- **When I drink** milk, **I get** stomach ache.

We use the first conditional to talk about things which might happen if an action takes place. We use **if** for things which are likely to happen and **when** for things which are certain to happen.

- **If I see** Freddy later, **I’ll give** him the book. (I’m not certain I’ll see him.)
- **When I see** Freddy later, I’**ll give** him the book. (I’m certain I’ll see him.)

- **If we go** to the beach, I’**ll take** my swimsuit. (It isn’t certain we’ll go to the beach.)
- **When we go** to the beach, I’**ll take** my swimsuit. (It is certain we’ll go to the beach.)

### Form

Conditional sentences have two parts: the **if/when** part and the result (**main**) part. The two parts can come in any order. When we write, we don’t use a comma when the **main** part comes first.  

- **I get** stomach ache **when I drink** milk.  
- **I’ll take** my swimsuit if we go to the beach.  

#### Zero conditional:

The zero conditional uses **if/when** **+** **present simple**, and **present simple**:

- **If/When you heat** water to 100°C, **it boils**.

##### Positive

- **When she eats** too much cake, **she feels** bad.
- **We always have** a good time **if we** **go** dancing.

##### Negative

- **I feel** upset **when he doesn’t answer** my calls.
- **If you mix** white and yellow, **you don’t get** orange.

##### Question

- **What comes** out of a volcano **when it erupts?**
- **Do eyelashes grow** again **if you cut** them off? **Yes, they do. / No, they don’t.**

#### First conditional:

The first conditional uses **if/when** **+** **present simple**, and **will** **+** **infinitive** (without ‘to’):

- **If/When we go** to Paris, **we'll visit** the Eiffel Tower.

##### Positive

- I’**ll do** the cooking this evening if **it’s** OK with you.  
- When they **finish** work, they’**ll** go home.  

##### Negative

- I **won’t** wait for you, if **you’re** late again.
- **When we go** camping, **we won’t take** our laptops.

##### Question

- **Where will he live when he moves** to the city?
- **If I don’t see you** later, **will you call** me? Yes, **I will.** / No, **I won’t.**

### Take note: the zero conditional and time

We use the zero conditional to talk about things which are always true. We use **the present tense**, but we are talking about **all time** (past, present and future).

- **If you multiply** 10 by 10, **it makes** 100.  
- **Plants grow when they get** water and sunshine.

### Take note: the first conditional and modals

We can use **modals** instead of **will** in first conditional sentences. For example, we can use **may**, **might**, **can** or **should**. We use **may** or **might** in the main part to show we are less certain than **will**, **should** to give advice, and **could** for possibility.

- **We might go** shopping later **if we have** enough time.
- **If you don’t feel** well, **you should stay** at home tonight.
- **When we finish** our homework, **we could watch** TV.

### Spoken English

In the first conditional, we often use the short form **’ll** in the main part instead of **will**. This short form can sometimes be difficult to hear, but it’s important to include the **’ll** sound. If you use the present tense in both parts, your sentence will sound like a zero conditional – and it won’t be grammatically correct!

- If we miss our flight, **we’ll take** the next one._ (Not: … **we take** the next one.)
- **They’ll** **meet** us at the airport if we arrive late._ (Not: **They meet** us at the airport …)
