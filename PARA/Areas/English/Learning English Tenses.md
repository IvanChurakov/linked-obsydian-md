### Usage

The present perfect is often used to talk about situations that started in the past and are continuing now. We sometimes use the present perfect in a question with **how long** to ask about how long a present situation has continued.

- **How long have Sasha and Tanya been** married?


The present perfect is often used to say whether an action has happened or not at the present time. The action might be necessary or expected by someone, and we want to say if it is complete or not.

- **I’ve done** the washing up, so come and sit down.




We use the **present perfect** in several ways.

1) to talk about our experiences in the past. We don't say when these happened because we are interested in the experience, not the time or date. We often use the words **ever** and **never**. 

- **Have you ever been** here?
- **I've never been** to Goa.

2) to talk about situations that started in the past and are continuing now. We sometimes ask a question with **how long + the present perfect** and we answer it with the words **for** or **since**.

- **We haven't seen** much yet.
- **The sun's just** disappeared!



When talking about a life experience, we can use the **present perfect**. We don't say when it happened because we're more interested in the experience, than the time or date.

- My wife **has seen** both Sex and the City movies.
### Sentence Structure

**Since** is used with a specific point in the past.

### Notes
#### present perfect / present perfect continuous
