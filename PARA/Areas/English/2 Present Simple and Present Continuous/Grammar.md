### Meaning and use

We use the present simple for:

- things that we do regularly
- facts and truths 
- habits
- permanent situations

We often use adverbs of frequency and time expressions like **every day, once a week, on Fridays**.

- _**I check** my email **every day**._ (regular activity)
- _**Sheryl works** at the bank._ (permanent situation)

We use the present continuous for:

- things that are happening now *–* at the time we are speaking,
- temporary situations
- activities that are in progress

We often use time expressions like **at the moment, today, this week**.

- _Just a minute. I_**_’m checking_** _my email._ (now)
- _She usually works in London, but she_**_’s working_** _from home this_ week. (temporary situation)
- _I’_**_m studying_** _Economics_ (activity in progress)

### Form - Positive

The present simple has the same form as the infinitive without 'to'’ for _I_, _you_, _we_ and _they_. For _he_, _she_ and _it_, we add **-s** or **-es** to the infinitive.

- _They **live** in Rome._
- _Julian **starts** work at nine o’clock and **finishes** at five_.

The present continuous for _I_ is **subject + am + verb-ing** For _you_, _we_ and _they_: **subject** **+** **are** **+ -verb-ing.** For _he_, _she_, _it:_ **subject** **+** **is** **+ verb-ing.** We usually use contractions (_I’m, he’s, they’re,_ etc.) when we are speaking.

- _Can I call you back later? We_**_’re having_** dinner right now.

### Form - Negative

The negative present simple is **subject** **+** **don’t** (do not) **+** **infinitive without 'to'** for _I_, _you_, _we_ and _they_, and **subject** **+** **doesn’t** (does not) **+** **infinitive without 'to'** for _he_, _she_ and _it_.

- **_I_** _**don’t eat** meat._**_It_** **_doesn’t_** _usually **snow** in October._

The negative present continuous for _I_ is **I’m not + verb-ing.**  For _you_, _we_ and _they_: **subject** **+** **aren’t** **+ verb-ing.** For _he_, _she_, _it:_ **subject** **+** **isn’t** **+ verb-ing.**

- **_He isn’t answering_** _his mobile at the moment._

### Form - questions

The present simple question form is **do/does** **+** **subject** **+** **infinitive without ‘to’**.

- **_Do you read_** _the news online every day_?
- **_Does the supermarket sell_** _stamps_?

The present continuous question form is **am/is/are + subject + verb-ing.** 

- _What **are** **you doing**_?
- **_Is it raining_**?

### Take note: spelling changes

In the present simple, regular verbs end in **-s** or **-es**_,_ but **-y** changes to **-i**.

_marry – marr**ies**      study – stud**ies**_

In the present continuous, all verbs end in **-ing**, but sometimes the spelling changes.

_make – mak**ing**   sit – sit**ting**    die – d**ying**_

### Take note: verbs we don’t use in the present continuous

There are some verbs that we don’t usually use in the continuous form. They are often verbs linked to the senses and thinking, for example: **hear, see, smell, hate, know, understand, believe, want, need.**

**Wrong:** _Could you explain that again? **I’m not understanding**._
**Correct:** _Could you explain that again? **I don’t understand**_.
