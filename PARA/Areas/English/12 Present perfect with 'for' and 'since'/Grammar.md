### Meaning and use

The present perfect is often used to talk about situations that started in the past and are continuing now. We sometimes use the present perfect in a question with **how long** to ask about how long a present situation has continued.

**_How long have Sasha and Tanya been_** _married?_

We talk about **how long** using the words **for** and **since**.

**For** = throughout (a period of time).

**_They’ve been_** _married **for** six months._


**Since** = from (an exact point in time) until now.

**_They’ve been_** _married **since** March._


We can also use present perfect + **since** + past simple.

**_I haven’t seen_** _Tanya **since we graduated**_.

### Form

The present perfect is made with **subject** **+** **have/has (positive) or haven’t/hasn’t (negative) +** **past participle.**

**For** is used with a length of time.

**Since** is used with a specific point in the past.

**for:** ten minutes, one hour, two days, a week, three years, a long time

**since:** 10 o'clock, Friday, November, 2013, Easter

#### Positive

***I’ve lived** here **since 2012**.*

***I’ve worked** for this company **for 20 years.***

#### Negative

**_We haven’t seen_** _her **for ages.**_

**_She hasn’t been_** _back to the UK **since 2009.**_

#### Question

**_Have you known_** _Sasha **since** **last year?**_

**_Have you lived_** _here **for** **more than two years?**_

**_How long have you known_** _him?_

**_Have you known_** _Sasha a long time?_

### Take note: present simple and present continuous

We cannot use the present simple or present continuous with **for** and **since**.

**WRONG:** **_I know_** _him for ten years_.

**CORRECT: _I’ve known_** _him for ten years_.

**WRONG:** **_I’m living_** _here **since 2002.**_

**CORRECT:** **_I’ve lived_** _here **since 2002.**_

### Take note: present perfect / present perfect continuous

With verbs like **work** and **live**, which can describe permanent or temporary situations, we usually use the present perfect + ‘for’ / ‘since’ for a long period of time. For a short period, we use the present perfect continuous.

**_I’ve worked_** _for this company **for 20 years**._ (present perfect)

**_I’ve been working_** _here **for a week**._ (present perfect continuous)

---
### Take note: present perfect / past simple

If a situation is finished, we use the past simple + ‘for’, not the present perfect:

**_I worked_** _for that company **for 20 years** and then I retired._

### Spoken English

In informal writing and in speech, we often use a contraction with the auxiliary verb.

**_I’ve lived_** _in Amsterdam for twelve years_.

When you listen to someone using a sentence with **for** +a period of time, listen carefully to the verb. It is sometimes difficult to hear the difference between, for example, **I’ve lived** **in New York** **for five years** and **I lived in New York** **for five years**, but it makes a big difference in meaning. It tells us whether the speaker still lives there or not.
